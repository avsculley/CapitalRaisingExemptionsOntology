# Ontology for U.S. Capital-Raising Exemptions

This repo is currently being used to facilitate a project on methods of combining LLMs and ontologies for legal applications in U.S. capital-raising exemptions.



Toward this end, there are three files: 

SecuritiesExemptionOntology.ttl was created mostly automatically using LLMs for definitions.

SecuritiesExemptionOntologyAuth.ttl was created by updating SecuritiesExemptionOntology.ttl with authoratative definitions from applicable laws.

SecuritiesExemptionOntologyBP.ttl is an ontology for Securities Exemptions using best practices from BFO-CCO ontology development.


## Plan for post-study repo

- Capital-Raising Exemptions Ontology (best practices)
- Overlay file with authoritative definitions, synonyms, and sources
