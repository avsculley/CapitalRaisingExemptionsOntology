            <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
            <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>

                <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
                <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
                <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, April 1, 2024), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
                <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>
                <P>
                    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. 
                    <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>
                    Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

                <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time.

                <P>
                    <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E>
                     Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
                </P>
                <P>
                    <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E>
                     The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
                </P>
                <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
                <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
                <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
                <P>
                    <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E>
                     If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.

                             For a security futures product on a single equity security, including a security futures product on an underlying security that represents ownership in a group of securities, e.g., an exchange traded fund, a designated contract market shall adopt a position limit no greater than 25,000 100-share contracts (or the equivalent if the contract size is different than 100 shares), either net or on the same side of the market, applicable to positions held during the last three trading days of an expiring contract month; except where:

                        <P>(A) For a security futures product on a single equity security where the estimated deliverable supply of the underlying security exceeds 20 million shares, a designated contract market may adopt, if appropriate in light of the liquidity of trading in the underlying security, a position limit no greater than the equivalent of 12.5 percent of the estimated deliverable supply of the underlying security, either net or on the same side of the market, applicable to positions held during the last three trading days of an expiring contract month; or</P>

Upon request by a designated contract market, traders who hold positions greater than 25,000 100-share contracts (or the equivalent if the contract size is different than 100 shares), or such lower level specified pursuant to the rules of the designated contract market, must provide information to the designated contract market and consent to halt increasing their positions when so ordered by the designated contract market.</P>

                             For a physically-delivered security futures product on more than one equity security, e.g., a basket of deliverable securities, a designated contract market shall adopt a position limit, either net or on the same side of the market, applicable to positions held during the last three trading days of an expiring contract month and the criteria in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section must apply to the underlying security with the lowest estimated deliverable supply. For a physically-delivered security futures product on more than one equity security with a contract size different than 100 shares per underlying security, an appropriate adjustment to the limit must be made. If each of the underlying equity securities in the basket of deliverable securities is eligible for a position accountability level under paragraph (b)(3)(i)(B) of this section, then the security futures product is eligible for a position accountability level in lieu of position limits.

                            the submission requirements of § 41.24.

                        <P>(B) If the estimated deliverable supply or six-month total trading volume data no longer supports a position accountability rule in lieu of a position limit for a security futures product, then the designated contract market shall establish a position limit for that security futures product pursuant to the submission requirements of § 41.24.</P>
                        <P>(C) If the estimated deliverable supply data supports a higher speculative limit for a security futures product, as provided under paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section, then the designated contract market may raise the position limit for that security futures product pursuant to the submission requirements of § 41.24.</P>

The rule submission must include a detailed demonstration of why an exception is warranted.

                             For a security futures product cash settled to a narrow-based security index of equity securities weighted by the number of shares outstanding, a designated contract market may set a position limit as follows: First, determine the limit on a security futures product on each underlying equity security pursuant to § 41.25(b)(3)(i); second, multiply each such limit by the ratio of the 100-share contract size and the shares of the equity securities in the index; and third, determine the minimum level from step two and set the limit to that level, given a contract size of one U.S. dollar times the index, or for a larger contract size, reduce the level proportionately. If under these procedures each of the equity securities underlying the index is determined to be eligible for position accountability levels, the security futures product on the index itself is eligible for a position accountability level.

                             A designated contract market should set the level of a position limit to no greater than the equivalent of 12.5 percent of the par value of the estimated deliverable supply of the underlying debt security. For a security futures product on more than one debt security, the limit should be based on the underlying debt security with the lowest estimated deliverable supply.

                         Any swap execution facility, designated contract market, or reporting counterparty that by any means becomes aware of any error relating to swap data that it was required to report under this part shall correct the error. To correct an error, the swap execution facility, designated contract market, or reporting counterparty shall submit complete and accurate swap data to the swap data repository that maintains the swap data for the relevant swap, or completely and accurately report swap data for a swap that was not previously reported to a swap data repository as required under this part, as applicable. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the requirement to correct any error applies regardless of the state of the swap that is the subject of the swap data, including a swap that has terminated, matured, or otherwise is no longer considered to be an open swap.

                         The swap execution facility, designated contract market, or reporting counterparty shall correct any error as soon as technologically practicable after discovery of the error. In all cases, errors shall be corrected within seven business days after discovery. Any error that a reporting counterparty discovers or could have discovered during the verification process required under paragraph (b) of this section is considered discovered for the purposes of this section as of the moment the reporting counterparty began the verification process during which the error was first discovered or discoverable.

                         If the swap execution facility, designated contract market, or reporting counterparty will, for any reason, fail to timely correct an error, the swap execution facility, designated contract market, or reporting counterparty shall notify the Director of the Division of Market Oversight, or such other employee or employees of the Commission as the Director may designate from time to time. The notification shall be in the form and manner, and according to the instructions, specified by the Director of the Division of Market Oversight, or such other employee or employees of the Commission as the Director may designate from time to time. Unless otherwise instructed by the Director of the Division of Market Oversight, or such other employee or employees of the Commission as the Director may designate from time to time, the notification shall include an initial assessment of the scope of the error or errors that were discovered, and shall include any initial remediation plan for correcting the error or errors, if an initial remediation plan exists. This notification shall be made within 12 hours of the swap execution facility's, designated contract market's, or reporting counterparty's determination that it will fail to timely correct the error.

If the non-reporting counterparty does not know the identity of the reporting counterparty, the non-reporting counterparty shall notify the swap execution facility or designated contract market where the swap was executed of the error as soon as technologically practicable after discovery, but no later than three business days following the discovery. Such notice from the non-reporting counterparty to the swap execution facility, designated contract market, or reporting counterparty constitutes discovery under this section.

                         The requirements to correct errors set forth in paragraph (a) of this section only apply to errors in swap data relating to swaps for which the record retention period under § 45.2 has not expired as of the time the error is discovered. Errors in swap data relating to swaps for which the record retention periods under § 45.2 have expired at the time that the errors are discovered are not subject to the requirements to correct errors set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.

                         Each reporting counterparty shall verify that there are no errors in the swap data for all open swaps that the reporting counterparty reported, or was required to report, to a swap data repository under the requirements of this part, in accordance with this paragraph (b).

                         Each reporting counterparty shall utilize the mechanism for verification that each swap data repository to which the reporting counterparty reports swap data adopts under § 49.11 of this chapter. Each reporting counterparty shall utilize the relevant mechanism(s) to compare all swap data for each open swap for which it serves as the reporting counterparty maintained by the relevant swap data repository or repositories with all swap data contained in the reporting counterparty's internal books and records for each swap, to verify that there are no errors in the relevant swap data maintained by the swap data repository. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a reporting counterparty is not required to verify the accuracy and completeness of any swap data to which the reporting counterparty is not permitted access under the Act or Commission regulations, including, but not limited to, § 49.17 of this chapter.

                         In performing verification as required by this paragraph, each reporting counterparty shall conform to each relevant swap data repository's verification policies and procedures created pursuant to § 49.11 of this chapter. If a reporting counterparty utilizes a third-party service provider to perform verification, the reporting counterparty shall conform to each relevant swap data repository's third-party service provider verification policies and procedures created pursuant to § 49.11 of this chapter and shall require the third-party service provider to conform to the same policies and procedures while performing verification on behalf of the reporting counterparty.

                         For the purposes of this part, there is an error when swap data is not completely and accurately reported. This includes, but is not limited to, the following circumstances:
                    </P>
                    <P>(i) Any of the swap data for a swap reported to a swap data repository is incorrect or any of the swap data that is maintained by a swap data repository differs from any of the relevant swap data contained in the books and records of a party to the swap.</P>
                    <P>(ii) Any of the swap data for a swap that is required to be reported to a swap data repository or to be maintained by a swap data repository is not reported to a swap data repository or is not maintained by the swap data repository as required by this part.</P>
                    <P>

                    <P>(iv) Any of the swap data for a swap that is no longer an open swap is maintained by the swap data repository as if the swap is still an open swap.</P>

                         For the purposes of this section, there is a presumption that an error exists if the swap data that is maintained and disseminated by an SDR for a swap is not complete and accurate. This includes, but is not limited to, the swap data that the SDR makes available to the reporting counterparty for verification under § 49.11 of this chapter.

                    <HD SOURCE="HD1">GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS</HD>
                    <P>1. A Supplement S-1 (including exhibits) shall be completed by each clearing organization that will be clearing trades executed on the trading system of a foreign board of trade applying for registration with the Commission pursuant to CEA section 4(b) and part 48 of the Commission's regulations. Each clearing organization shall submit a separate Supplement S-1.</P>
                    <P>2. In the event that the clearing functions of the foreign board of trade applying for registration will be performed by the foreign board of trade itself, the foreign board of trade shall complete this Supplement S-1, but need not duplicate information provided on its Form FBOT. Specific reference to or incorporation of information or documentation (including exhibits) on the associated Form FBOT, where appropriate, is acceptable. To the extent a singular document or description is responsive to more than one request for information in this Supplement S-1, the document or description need only be provided once and may be cross-referenced elsewhere.</P>
                    <P>
                        3. Supplement S-1, including exhibits, should accompany the foreign board of trade's Form FBOT and must be filed electronically with the Secretary of the Commission at

                    <P>5. Supplement S-1 must be signed by the Chief Executive Officer (or the functional equivalent) of the clearing organization who must possess the authority to bind the clearing organization.</P>
                    <P>6. If this Supplement S-1 is being filed in connection with a new application for registration, all applicable items must be answered in full. If any item is not applicable, indicate by marking “none” or “N/A.”</P>
                    <P>7. Submission of a complete Form FBOT and Supplement S-1 (including all information, documentation and exhibits requested therein) is mandatory and must be received by the Commission before it will begin to process a foreign board of trade's application for registration. The information provided with a Form FBOT and Supplement S-1 will be used to determine whether the Commission should approve or deny registration to an applicant. Pursuant to its regulations, the Commission may determine that information and/or documentation in addition to that requested in the Form FBOT and Supplement S-1 is required from the applicant and/or its clearing organization(s) in order to process the application for registration or to determine whether registration is appropriate.</P>
                    <P>
                        8. Pursuant to Commission regulations, an applicant or its clearing organization must identify with particularity any information in the application (including, but not limited to, any information contained in this Supplement S-1), that will be the subject of a request for confidential treatment and must provide support for any request for confidential treatment pursuant to the procedures set forth in Commission regulation 145.9.

The Commission may revoke a foreign board of trade's registration, after appropriate notice and an opportunity to respond, if the Commission determines that a representation made in this Supplement S-1 is found to be untrue or materially misleading or if the foreign board of trade and/or clearing organization failed to include information in this Supplement S-1 that would have been material to the Commission's determination as to whether to issue an Order of Registration.

When appropriate, potential applicants and clearing organizations, as applicable, may provide a complete draft Form FBOT and Supplement S-1 to the Division of Market Oversight for early review to minimize the risk of having a submission returned or otherwise denied as not acceptable for filing.

                        <E T="03">Application procedures.</E>
                         (1) An applicant, person or entity desiring to be registered as a swap data repository shall file electronically an application for registration on Form SDR provided in appendix A to this part, with the Secretary of the Commission at its headquarters in Washington, DC in a format and in the manner specified by the Secretary of the Commission in accordance with the instructions contained therein.
                        <PRTPAGE P="164"/>
                    </P>
                    <P>(2) The application shall include information sufficient to demonstrate compliance with core principles specified in Section 21 of the Act and the regulations thereunder. Form SDR consists of instructions, general questions and a list of Exhibits (documents, information and evidence) required by the Commission in order to determine whether an applicant is able to comply with the core principles. An application will not be considered to be materially complete unless the applicant has submitted, at a minimum, the exhibits as required in Form SDR. If the application is not materially complete, the Commission shall notify the applicant that the application will not be deemed to have been submitted for purposes of the 180-day review procedures.</P>
                    <P>

                        <E T="03">180-Day review procedures.</E>
                         The Commission will review the application for registration as a swap data repository within 180 days of the date of the filing of such application. In considering an application for registration as a swap data repository, the staff of the Commission shall include in its review, an applicant's past relevant submissions and compliance history. At or prior to the conclusion of the 180-day period, the Commission will either by order grant registration; extend, by order, the 180-day review period for good cause; or deny the application for registration as a swap data repository. The 180-day review period shall commence once a completed submission on Form SDR is submitted to the Commission. The determination of when such submission on Form SDR is complete shall be at the sole discretion of the Commission. If deemed appropriate, the Commission may grant registration as a swap data repository subject to conditions. If the Commission denies an application for registration as a swap data repository, it shall specify the grounds for such denial. In the event of a denial of registration for a swap data repository, any person so denied shall be afforded an opportunity for a hearing before the Commission.

                         The Commission shall grant the registration of a swap data repository if the Commission finds that such swap data repository is appropriately organized, and has the capacity: to ensure the prompt, accurate and reliable performance of its functions as a swap data repository; comply with any applicable provisions of the Act and regulations thereunder; carry out its functions in a manner consistent with the purposes of Section 21 of the Act and the regulations thereunder; and operate in a fair, equitable and consistent manner. The Commission shall deny registration of a swap data repository if it appears that the application is materially incomplete; fails in form or substance to meet the requirements of Section 21 of the Act and part 49; or is amended or supplemented in a manner that is inconsistent with this § 49.3. The Commission shall notify the applicant seeking registration that the Commission is denying the application setting forth the deficiencies in the application, and/or the manner in which the application fails to meet the requirements of this part.

                        <E T="03">Amendments.</E>
                         If any information reported on Form SDR or in any amendment thereto is or becomes inaccurate for any reason, whether before or after the application for registration has been granted under this paragraph (a), the swap data repository shall promptly file an amendment on Form SDR updating such information.
                    </P>

                         Each swap data repository shall designate and authorize on Form SDR an agent in the United States, other than a Commission official, who shall accept any notice or service of process, pleadings, or other documents in any action or proceedings brought against the swap data repository to enforce the Act and the regulations thereunder.

                         The Commission, upon the request of an applicant, may grant provisional registration of a swap data repository if such applicant is in substantial compliance with the standards set forth in paragraph (a)(4) of this section and is able to demonstrate operational capability, real-time processing, multiple redundancy and robust security controls. Such provisional registration of a swap data repository shall expire on the earlier of: the date that the Commission grants or denies registration of the swap data repository; or the date that 
                        <PRTPAGE P="165"/>
                        the Commission rescinds the temporary registration of the swap data repository. This paragraph (b) shall terminate within such time as determined by the Commission. A provisional registration granted by the Commission does not affect the right of the Commission to grant or deny permanent registration as provided under paragraph (a)(3) of this section.

                         An applicant for registration may withdraw its application submitted pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section by filing with the Commission such a request. Withdrawal of an application for registration shall not affect any action taken or to be taken by the Commission based upon actions, activities, or events occurring during the time that the application for registration was pending with the Commission, and shall not prejudice the filing of a new application by such applicant.

Pending final determination whether any registration shall be revoked, the Commission, by order, may suspend such registration, if such suspension appears to the Commission, after notice and opportunity for hearing, to be necessary or appropriate and in the public interest.

                         If SDR data contains one or more data validation errors, the swap data repository shall distribute a data validation error message to the designated contract market, swap execution facility, reporting counterparty, or third-party service provider that submitted such SDR data as soon as technologically practicable after acceptance of such data. Each data validation error message shall indicate which specific data validation error(s) was identified in the SDR data.

                         If a swap data repository allows for the joint submission of swap transaction and pricing data and swap data, the swap data repository shall validate the swap transaction and pricing data and swap data separately. Swap transaction and pricing data that satisfies the data validation procedures applied by a swap data repository shall not be deemed to contain a data validation error because it was submitted to the swap data repository jointly with swap data that contained a data validation error.

                         Each swap data repository shall provide a mechanism that allows each reporting counterparty that is a user of the swap data repository to access all swap data maintained by the swap data repository for each open swap for which the reporting counterparty is serving as the reporting counterparty, as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. This mechanism shall allow sufficient access, provide sufficient information, and be in a form and manner to enable each reporting counterparty to perform swap data verification as required under § 45.14 of this chapter.

                    <P>(2) A swap data repository may declare, on an ad hoc basis, special closing hours to perform system maintenance that cannot wait until normal closing hours. A swap data repository shall schedule special closing hours during periods when, in the reasonable estimation of the swap data repository in the context of the circumstances prompting the special closing hours, the special closing hours will be the least disruptive to the swap data repository's SDR data reporting responsibilities. A swap data repository shall provide reasonable advance notice of its special closing hours to market participants and to the public whenever possible, and, if advance notice is not reasonably possible, shall provide notice of its special closing hours to market participants and to the public as soon as reasonably possible after declaring special closing hours.</P>
                    <P>(b) A swap data repository shall comply with the requirements under part 40 of this chapter in adopting or amending normal closing hours and special closing hours.</P>
                    <P>(c) During normal closing hours and special closing hours, a swap data repository shall have the capability to accept and hold in queue any and all SDR data reported to the swap data repository during the normal closing hours or special closing hours.</P>
                    <P>(1) Upon reopening after normal closing hours or special closing hours, a swap data repository shall promptly process all SDR data received during normal closing hours or special closing hours, as required pursuant to this chapter, and, pursuant to part 43 of this chapter, publicly disseminate all swap transaction and pricing data reported to the swap data repository that was held in queue during the normal closing hours or special closing hours.</P>
                    <P>
                        (2) If at any time during normal closing hours or special closing hours a swap data repository is unable to receive and hold in queue any SDR data reported pursuant to this chapter, then the swap data repository shall immediately issue notice to all swap execution facilities, designated contract markets, reporting counterparties, and the public that it is unable to receive and hold in queue SDR data. Immediately upon reopening, the swap data repository shall issue notice to all swap execution facilities, designated contract markets, reporting counterparties, and the public that it has resumed normal operations. Any swap

                        execution facility, designated contract market, or reporting counterparty that was obligated to report SDR data pursuant to this chapter to the swap data repository, but could not do so because of the swap data repository's inability to receive and hold in queue SDR data, shall report the SDR data to the swap data repository immediately after receiving such notice.

A banking entity may not rely on such information barriers if, in the case of any specific transaction, class or type of transactions or activity, the banking entity knows or should reasonably know that, notwithstanding the banking entity's establishment of information barriers, the conflict of interest may involve or result in a materially adverse effect on a client, customer, or counterparty.

A banking entity may not rely on such information barriers if, in the case of any specific transaction, class or type of transactions or activity, the banking entity knows or should reasonably know that, notwithstanding the banking entity's establishment of information barriers, the conflict of interest may involve or result in a materially adverse effect on a client, customer, or counterparty.

                        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Purpose</HD>
                        <P>a. This appendix sets forth reporting and recordkeeping requirements that certain banking entities must satisfy in connection with the restrictions on proprietary trading set forth in subpart B (“proprietary trading restrictions”). Pursuant to § 75.20(d), this appendix applies to a banking entity that, together with its affiliates and subsidiaries, has significant trading assets and liabilities. These entities are required to (i) furnish periodic reports to the CFTC regarding a variety of quantitative measurements of their covered trading activities, which vary depending on the scope and size of covered trading activities, and (ii) create and maintain records documenting the preparation and content of these reports. The requirements of this appendix must be incorporated into the banking entity's internal compliance program under § 75.20.</P>
                        <P>b. The purpose of this appendix is to assist banking entities and the CFTC in:</P>
                        <P>(1) Better understanding and evaluating the scope, type, and profile of the banking entity's covered trading activities;</P>
                        <P>(2) Monitoring the banking entity's covered trading activities;</P>
                        <P>(3) Identifying covered trading activities that warrant further review or examination by the banking entity to verify compliance with the proprietary trading restrictions;</P>
                        <P>(4) Evaluating whether the covered trading activities of trading desks engaged in market making-related activities subject to § 75.4(b) are consistent with the requirements governing permitted market making-related activities;</P>
                        <P>
                            (5) Evaluating whether the covered trading activities of trading desks that are engaged in permitted trading activity subject to § 75.4, 75.5, or 75.6(a) and (b) (
                            <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                             underwriting and market making-related activity, risk-mitigating hedging, or trading in certain government obligations) are consistent with the requirement that such activity not result, directly or indirectly, in a material exposure to high-risk assets or high-risk trading strategies;
                        </P>
                        <P>(6) Identifying the profile of particular covered trading activities of the banking entity, and the individual trading desks of the banking entity, to help establish the appropriate frequency and scope of examination by CFTC of such activities; and</P>
                        <P>(7) Assessing and addressing the risks associated with the banking entity's covered trading activities.</P>
                        <P>c. Information that must be furnished pursuant to this appendix is not intended to serve as a dispositive tool for the identification of permissible or impermissible activities.</P>
                        <P>d. In addition to the quantitative measurements required in this appendix, a banking entity may need to develop and implement other quantitative measurements in order to effectively monitor its covered trading activities for compliance with section 13 of the BHC Act and this part and to have an effective compliance program, as required by § 75.20. The effectiveness of particular quantitative measurements may differ based on the profile of the banking entity's businesses in general and, more specifically, of the particular trading desk, including types of instruments traded, trading activities and strategies, and history and experience (e.g., whether the trading desk is an established, successful market maker or a new entrant to a competitive market). In all cases, banking entities must ensure that they have robust measures in place to identify and monitor the risks taken in their trading activities, to ensure that the activities are within risk tolerances established by the banking entity, and to monitor and examine for compliance with the proprietary trading restrictions in this part.</P>
                        <P>e. On an ongoing basis, banking entities must carefully monitor, review, and evaluate all furnished quantitative measurements, as well as any others that they choose to utilize in order to maintain compliance with section 13 of the BHC Act and this part. All measurement results that indicate a heightened risk of impermissible proprietary trading, including with respect to otherwise-permitted activities under §§ 75.4 through 75.6(a) and (b), or that result in a material exposure to high-risk assets or high-risk trading strategies, must be escalated within the banking entity for review, further analysis, explanation to CFTC, and remediation, where appropriate. The quantitative measurements discussed in this appendix should be helpful to banking entities in identifying and managing the risks related to their covered trading activities.</P>

                             For purposes of this appendix, Internal Limits are the constraints that define the amount of risk and the positions that a trading desk is permitted to take at a point in time, as defined by the banking entity for a specific trading desk. Usage represents the value of the trading desk's risk or positions that are accounted for by the current activity of the desk. Internal limits and their usage are key compliance and risk management tools used to control and monitor risk taking and include, but are not limited to, the limits set out in §§ 75.4 and 75.5. A trading desk's risk limits, commonly including a limit on “Value-at-Risk,” are useful in the broader context of the trading desk's overall activities, particularly for the market making activities under § 75.4(b) and hedging activity under § 75.5. Accordingly, the limits required under §§ 75.4(b)(2)(iii)(C) and 75.5(b)(1)(i)(A) must meet the applicable requirements under §§ 75.4(b)(2)(iii)(C) and 75.5(b)(1)(i)(A) and also must include appropriate metrics for the trading desk limits including, at a minimum, “Value-at-Risk” except to the extent the “Value-at-Risk” metric is demonstrably ineffective for measuring and monitoring the risks of a trading desk based on the types of positions traded by, and risk exposures of, that desk.
                        </P>
                        <P>A. A banking entity must provide the following information for each limit reported pursuant to this quantitative measurement: The unique identification label for the limit reported in the Internal Limits Information Schedule, the limit size (distinguishing between an upper and a lower limit), and the value of usage of the limit.</P>

                             For purposes of this appendix, Comprehensive Profit and Loss Attribution is an analysis that attributes the daily fluctuation in the value of a trading desk's positions to various sources. First, the daily profit and loss of the aggregated positions is divided into two categories: (i) Profit and loss attributable to a trading desk's existing positions that were also positions held by the trading desk as of the end of the prior day (“existing positions”); and (ii) profit and loss attributable to new positions resulting from the current day's trading activity (“new positions”).

                            A. The comprehensive profit and loss associated with existing positions must reflect changes in the value of these positions on the applicable day. The comprehensive profit and loss from existing positions must be further attributed, as applicable, to (i) changes in the specific risk factors and other factors that are monitored and managed as part of the trading desk's overall risk management policies and procedures; and (ii) any other applicable elements, such as cash flows,

                        <P>B. For the attribution of comprehensive profit and loss from existing positions to specific risk factors and other factors, a banking entity must provide the following information for the factors that explain the preponderance of the profit or loss changes due to risk factor changes: The unique identification label for the risk factor or other factor listed in the Risk Factor Attribution Information Schedule, and the profit or loss due to the risk factor or other factor change.</P>
                        <P>C. The comprehensive profit and loss attributed to new positions must reflect commissions and fee income or expense and market gains or losses associated with transactions executed on the applicable day. New positions include purchases and sales of financial instruments and other assets/liabilities and negotiated amendments to existing positions. The comprehensive profit and loss from new positions may be reported in the aggregate and does not need to be further attributed to specific sources.</P>
                        <P>D. The portion of comprehensive profit and loss from existing positions that is not attributed to changes in specific risk factors and other factors must be allocated to a residual category. Significant unexplained profit and loss must be escalated for further investigation and analysis.</P>

                             No person shall be given access to classified information unless a favorable determination has been made as to the person's trustworthiness.

                             means a written grant of relief issued by the staff of a Division of the Commission from the applicability of a specific provision of the Act or of a rule, regulation or order issued thereunder by the Commission. An exemptive letter may only be issued by staff of a Division when the Commission itself has exemptive authority and that authority has been delegated by the Commission to the Division in question. An exemptive letter binds the Commission and its staff with respect to the relief provided therein. Only the Beneficiary may rely upon the exemptive letter.

A no-action letter represents the position only of the Division that issued it, or the Office of the General Counsel if issued thereby. A no-action letter binds only the issuing Division or the Office of the General Counsel, as applicable, and not the Commission or other Commission staff. Only the Beneficiary may rely upon the no-action letter.

                            Division or the Office of the General Counsel, as applicable, and does not bind the Commission or other Commission staff. An interpretative letter may be relied upon by persons in addition to the Beneficiary.

                        <P>(D) The date of acceptance.</P>
                        <P>(6) Not later than January 31 of each year the Executive Director shall compile a listing of all statements filed during the preceding year by Commission members and employees pursuant to paragraphs (c)(4) and (c)(5) of this section and shall transmit the listing to the Secretary of State.</P>
                        <P>(d) Commission members or employees may accept, retain and wear decorations tendered by a foreign government in recognition of active field service in time of combat operations or awarded for other outstanding or unusually meritorious performance, subject to the approval of the Executive Director. Without this approval, the decoration is deemed to have been accepted on behalf of the United States, shall become the property of the United States, and shall be deposited by the employee, within 60 days of acceptance, with the Executive Director for official use or forwarding to the Administrator of General Services for disposal in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section. Under normal circumstances, it can be expected that a Commission member or employee will be notified of the intent of a foreign government to award him or her or a spouse or dependent a decoration for outstanding or unusually meritorious service sufficiently in advance so that the approval required can be sought prior to its acceptance. A request for the approval of the Executive Director shall be submitted in writing, stating the nature of the decoration and the reason why it is being awarded. Whenever possible, the request should also be accompanied by a statement from the foreign government, preferably in the form of the citation, which shows the basis for the tender of the award, whether it is in recognition of active field service in time of combat operations or for other outstanding or unusually meritorious performance.</P>
                        <P>(e) Within 60 days after acceptance of a tangible gift of more than minimal value or a decoration for which the Executive Director has not given approval, a Commission member or employee shall:</P>
                        <P>
                            (1) Deposit the gift or decoration for disposal with the Executive Director; or

                        </P>
                        <P>(2) Subject to the approval of the Commission, upon the recommendation of the Executive Director, deposit the gift or decoration with the Commission for official use.</P>
                        <FP>A gift or decoration may be retained for official use if the Commission determines that it can be properly displayed in an area accessible to employees and members of the public. Within 30 days after termination of the official use of a gift, the Executive Director shall forward the gift to the Administrator of General Services in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.</FP>
                        <P>(f) Whenever possible, gifts and decorations that have been deposited with the Executive Director for disposal shall be returned to the donor. The Executive Director, in coordination with the Office of the General Counsel, shall examine the circumstances surrounding the donation, assessing whether any adverse effect on the foreign relations of the United States might result from the return of the gift or decoration to the donor. The appropriate Department of State officials shall be consulted if a question of adverse effect on United States foreign relations arises.</P>
                        <P>(g) Gifts and decorations that have not been returned to the donor, retained for official use, or for which official use has terminated, shall be forwarded by the Executive Director to the Administrator of General Services for transfer, donation, or other disposal in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended, and 5 U.S.C. 7342.</P>
                        <P>(h) In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 7342(h), the U.S. Attorney General may bring a civil action in any United States district court against any Commission member or employee who knowingly solicits or accepts a gift from a foreign government not consented to by the Congress of the United States in 5 U.S.C. 7342, or who fails to deposit or report such gift as required by 5 U.S.C. 7342. The court may assess a penalty against such Commission member or employee in any amount not exceeding the retail value of the gift improperly solicited or received plus $5,000.</P>
                        <P>(i) A violation of the requirements set forth in this section by a Commission employee may be cause for appropriate disciplinary action which may be in addition to any penalty prescribed by law.</P>
                        <P>(j)(1) The burden of proving minimal value shall be on the recipient. In the event of a dispute over the value of a gift, the Executive Director shall arrange for an outside appraiser to determine whether the gift is of more or less than minimal value.</P>
                        <P>(2) When requested by the Administrator of Government Services, the Executive Director shall arrange for an appraisal of a gift or decoration.</P>
                        <P>(k) No appropriated funds of the Commission may be used to buy any tangible gift of more than minimal value for any foreign individual, unless the gift has been approved by Congress.</P>

                    <P>(1) Arrange for a hearing upon the proper petitioning by the employee;</P>
                    <P>(2) Certify to the paying agency in writing that the employee owes the debt, the amount and basis of the debt, the date on which payment is due, the date the Government's right to collect the debt accrued, and that Commission regulations for salary offset have been approved by the Office of Personnel Management;</P>
                    <P>(3) If collection must be made in installments, the Commission must advise the paying agency of the amount or percentage of disposable pay to be collected in each installment;</P>
                    <P>(4) Advise the paying agency of the actions taken under 5 U.S.C. 5514(b) and provide the dates on which action was taken unless the employee has consented to salary offset in writing or signed a statement acknowledging that the Commission has complied with the procedures required by law. The written consent or acknowledgment must be sent to the paying agency;</P>
                    <P>(5) If the employee is in the process of separating, the Commission must submit its debt claim to the paying agency as provided in this part. The paying agency must certify any amounts already collected, notify the employee, and send a copy of the certification and notice of the employee's separation to the Commission. If the paying agency is aware that the employee is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund or similar payments, it must certify to the agency responsible for making such payments the amount of the debt and that the provisions of 5 CFR 550.1108 have been followed; and</P>
                    <P>(6) If the employee has already separated and all payments due from the paying agency have been paid, the Commission may request, unless otherwise prohibited, that money payable to the employee from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund or other similar funds be collected by administrative offset.</P>

The employee must receive written notice from the Commission that the Commission has received a certified debt claim from the creditor agency, the amount of the debt, the date salary offset will begin, and the amount of the deduction(s). The Commission shall not review the merits of the creditor agency's determination of the validity or the amount of the certified claim.
                    </P>
                    <P>(2) If the employee transfers to another agency after the creditor agency has submitted its debt claim to the Commission and before the debt is collected completely, the Commission must certify the total amount collected. One copy of the certification must be furnished to the employee. A copy must be furnished the creditor agency with notice of the employee's transfer.</P>

Debts will be collected in one lump sum where possible. If the employee is financially unable to pay in one lump sum, collection must be made in installments.

                    <P>(c) Installment deductions will be made over a period not greater than the anticipated period of employment. The size of installment deductions must bear a reasonable relationship to the size of the debt and the employee's ability to pay. The deduction for the pay intervals for any period must not exceed 15% of disposable pay unless the employee has agreed in writing to a deduction of a greater amount.</P>
                    <P>(d) Unliquidated debts may be offset against any financial payment due to a separated employee including but not limited to final salary or leave payments in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3716.</P>

                        <PRTPAGE P="296"/>
                        verdict, judgment or other monetary award which is rendered against any employee, provided that the conduct giving rise to the verdict, judgment or award was taken within the scope of his or her employment with the Commission and that such indemnification is in the interest of the United States, as determined by the Commission.
                    </P>
                    <P>(b) The Commission may settle or compromise a personal damage claim against its employee by the payment of available funds, at any time, provided the alleged conduct giving rise to the personal damage claim was taken within the scope of employment and that such settlement is in the interest of the United States as determined by the Commission in its discretion.</P>
                    <P>(c) Absent exceptional circumstances, as determined by the Commission, the Commission will not entertain a request either to agree to indemnify or to settle a personal damage claim before entry of an adverse verdict, judgment or monetary award.</P>
                    <P>(d) When an employee of the Commission becomes aware that an action may be or has been filed against the employee in his or her individual capacity as a result of conduct taken within the scope of his or her employment, the employee should immediately notify the Commission's Office of General Counsel that such an action is pending or threatened.</P>
                    <P>(e) The employee may thereafter request either (1) indemnification to satisfy a verdict, judgment or award entered against the employee or (2) payment to satisfy the requirements of a settlement proposal.

                    <P>(f) Any payment under this section either to indemnify a Commodity Futures Trading Commission employee or to settle a personal damage claim shall be contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.</P>

                        This part provides procedures that the Commission will use to collect debts owed the United States arising from activities under the Commission's jurisdiction. As applicable, these procedures are based upon, and conform to, the Federal Claims Collection Act, as amended, 31 U.S.C. 3701-3720E; the Federal Claims Collection Standards, 31 CFR Parts 900-905, issued by the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Justice; administrative wage garnishment regulations issued by the Department of the Treasury, 31 CFR 285.11; and other laws applicable to the collection of non-tax debts owed to the United States arising from activities under the Commission's jurisdiction. Subpart A describes procedures 
                        <PRTPAGE P="297"/>
                        for collection by offset against obligations of the United States to the debtor, by compromise, and by referral to the Department of Justice for litigation. It also sets forth the Commission's policy on collecting interest on unpaid claims, the method used in calculating such interest, and the maximum inflation-adjusted civil monetary penalties that may be assessed and enforced for each violation of the Commodity Exchange Act or regulations or orders of the Commission promulgated thereunder. Subpart B describes procedures for collection by administrative garnishment of the debtor's wages.

                        <P>(b) If the claim is disputed, the debtor shall respond to the notice in writing and state the reasons for non-payment. If the claim is not disputed but full payment is not made by the date indicated in the notice, the debtor shall state the reasons for the failure to make full payment.</P>
                        <P>(c) If no response or an unsatisfactory response is received by the date indicated in the notice, the Commission may take further action as appropriate under the Commodity Exchange Act or regulations thereunder, or under 31 CFR parts 900-905 or the Federal Claims Collection Act as amended, 31 U.S.C. 3701-3720E.</P>

                        <P>
                            (a) The Commission will assess interest on unpaid claims. The rate of interest assessed shall be the rate of the current value of funds to the U.S. Treasury (
                            <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                             the Treasury tax and loan account rate) as prescribed and published by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Commission will charge penalty fees of not more than 6 percent per year on any portion of a claim that is delinquent for more than 90 days. The Commission will also impose actual administrative costs to cover the processing and handling of delinquent claims.
                        </P>
                        <P>(b) Interest on claims will be charged and will run from the date the notice of claim is mailed if the amount of the claim is not paid within 30 days from that date. Interest will be calculated only on the principal of the claim. The rate of interest charged is the rate in effect on the date from which interest begins to run. The rate will remain fixed for the duration of the indebtedness.</P>
                        <P>(c) The Commission may waive in whole or in part interest, penalty charges or administrative costs if it finds that:</P>
                        <P>(1) The debtor is unable to pay any significant sum within a reasonable period of time;</P>
                        <P>(2) Collection of interest or penalty charges jeopardizes collection of the principal of the claim; or</P>
                        <P>(3) It is in the best interests of the United States.</P>

                        <P>(a) Whenever feasible, the Commission will collect claims under this part by means of administrative offset against obligations of the United States to the debtor.</P>
                        <P>(b) The Commission will notify the debtor in writing of its intent to use offset procedures to collect the debt unless the debtor agrees to repayment. The notice to the debtor shall include the type and amount of the claim and an explanation of the debtor's rights for records and review under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a).</P>
                        <P>(c) The Commission will seek to coordinate administrative offset with other federal agencies in accordance with 4 CFR part 102.</P>

                        <P>(c) The cost of collecting the claim in full is not justified by the amount of the claim; or</P>
                        <P>(d) The Commission's enforcement policy would be served by settlement of the claim for less than the full amount.</P>

                             The Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, as amended, requires annual inflation adjustments to the civil monetary penalties imposed under the Commodity Exchange Act for violations that occurred on or after November 2, 2015. The Commission will publish notice of these adjusted penalty amounts in the 
                            <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
                             The inflation adjustment is calculated by multiplying the maximum dollar amount of the civil monetary penalty for the previous calendar year by the cost-of-living inflation adjustment multiplier provided by the Office Management and Budget, which is based on the change in the Consumer Price Index, and rounding the total to the nearest dollar. Set forth in the charts in paragraph (b) of this section are the inflation adjusted penalty amounts for violations occurring on or after November 2, 2015 and the penalty amounts for violations that occurred prior to November 2, 2015. These penalty charts are also available on the Commission's website at:

                         Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section with respect to public records, all requests for records maintained by the Commission shall be in writing, shall be addressed to the Office of General Counsel of the Commission and shall be clearly marked “Freedom of Information Act Request.”

                         The Commission cannot ensure that a timely or satisfactory response will be given to requests for records that are directed to the Commission other than in the manner prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section. Any misdirected written request for nonpublic records should be promptly forwarded to the Office of General Counsel of the Commission. Misdirected requests for nonpublic records will be considered to have been received for purposes of this section only when they actually have been received by the Office of General Counsel.

                         The Commission's response to a request for nonpublic records will encompass all nonpublic records identifiable as responsive to the request that are in existence on the date that the written request is received by the Office of General Counsel.

                         A request for copies of records pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section must indicate the requester's agreement to pay all fees that are associated with the processing of the request, in accordance with the rates set forth in appendix B to this part, or the requester's intention to limit the fees incurred to a stated amount. If the requester states a fee limitation, no work will be done that will result in fees beyond the stated amount. A requester who seeks a waiver or reduction of fees pursuant to paragraph (b) of appendix B of this part must show that such a waiver or reduction would be in the public interest. If the Office of General Counsel receives a request for records under paragraph (b) of this section from a requester who has not paid fees from a previous request in accordance with appendix B of this part, the staff will decline to process the request until such fees have been paid.

If a responsive record is located, the Compliance Staff will, in consultation with the Commission office in which the record was located, determine whether to comply with such request. The Compliance Staff may, in their discretion, determine whether to comply with any portion of a request for nonpublic records before considering the remainder of the request. The Compliance Staff will inform the requester of the availability of the Commission's FOIA Public Liaison to offer assistance.

The Compliance Staff's response to the FOIA request should describe in general terms what categories of documents are being withheld under which applicable FOIA exemption or exemptions. The Compliance Staff's response will include a statement notifying the requester of the right to seek dispute resolution services from the Commission's FOIA Public Liaison and the National Archives and Records Administration's Office of Government Information Services. The Compliance Staff, in denying an initial request for records, is not required to provide the requester with an inventory of those documents determined to be exempt from disclosure.</P>

                        (3) The Compliance Staff will issue an initial determination with respect to a FOIA request within twenty business days after receipt by the Office of General Counsel. In unusual circumstances, as defined in this paragraph, the prescribed time limit may be extended by written notice to the person making a request for a record or a copy. The notice shall set forth the reasons for the extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be dispatched. Where the extension exceeds ten business days, the Compliance Staff will provide the requester with an opportunity to modify the request or arrange an alternative time period for processing the original or modified request. The Compliance Staff or the FOIA Public Liaison is available to assist the requester in unusual circumstances. The Compliance Staff will notify the requester of the right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services.

An application for review shall be in writing and shall be marked “Freedom of Information Act Appeal” and be sent to the Commission's Office of General Counsel. If the appeal involves information as to which the FOIA requester has received a detailed written justification of a request for confidential treatment pursuant to § 145.9(e), the requester must also serve a copy of the appeal on the submitter of the information.</P>
                    <P>

                    <P>(5) If the appeal involves information that is subject to a petition for confidential treatment filed under § 145.9, the submitter of the information shall have an opportunity to respond in writing to the appeal within 10 business days of the date of filing the appeal. Any response shall be sent to the Commission's Office of General Counsel. Copies shall be sent to the person requesting the information.</P>
                    <P>(6) The General Counsel, or his or her designee, shall have the authority to consider all appeals under this section from initial determinations of the Compliance Staff of the Commission. The General Counsel, or his or her designee, may:</P>

If, on appeal, the denial of access to a record is affirmed in whole or in part, the person who requested the information shall be notified in writing of:</P>

                         A request may be given expedited processing if the requester demonstrates a compelling need for the requested records. For purposes of this provision, the term “compelling need” means: That a failure to obtain requested records on an expedited basis could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or with respect to a request made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information, urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged federal government activity. A requester who seeks expedited processing must demonstrate a compelling need by submitting a statement that is certified by the requester to be true and correct to the best of that person's knowledge and belief. The Compliance Staff will determine whether to provide expedited processing, and notice of the determination will be provided to requester, within ten days after the date of the request. If the request for expedited processing is denied, the requester may file an appeal with the Office of General Counsel within ten days of the date of the denial by the Compliance Staff.

                        <E T="03">Purpose.</E>
                         This section provides a procedure by which persons submitting information in any form to the Commission can request that the information not be disclosed pursuant to a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. This section does not affect the Commission's right, authority, or obligation to disclose information in any other context.
                    </P>

                        (b) 
                        <E T="03">Scope.</E>
                         The provisions of this section shall apply only where the Commission has not specified that an alternative procedure be utilized in connection with a particular study, report, investigation, or other matter. See 40.8 for procedures to be utilized in connection with filing information required to be filed pursuant to 17 CFR parts 40 and 41.

                    <P>
                        (c) 
                        <E T="03">Definitions.</E>
                         The following definitions apply to this section:
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        (1) 
                        <E T="03">Submitter.</E>
                         A “submitter” is any person who submits any information or material to the Commission or who permits any information or material to be submitted to the Commission. For purposes of paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section only, “submitter” includes any person whose information has been submitted to a designated contract market, derivatives clearing organization, swap execution facility, swap data repository or registered futures association that in turn has submitted the information to the Commission.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        (2) 
                        <E T="03">FOIA requester.</E>
                         A “FOIA requester” is any person who files with the Commission a request to inspect or copy Commission records or documents pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        (d) 
                        <E T="03">Written request for confidential treatment.</E>
                         (1) Any submitter may request in writing that the Commission afford confidential treatment under the Freedom of Information Act to any information that he or she submits to the Commission. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, no oral requests for confidential treatment will be accepted by the Commission. The submitter shall specify the grounds on which confidential treatment is being requested but need not provide a detailed written justification 
                        <PRTPAGE P="311"/>
                        of the request unless required to do so under paragraph (e) of this section. Confidential treatment may be requested only on the grounds that disclosure:
                    </P>
                    <P>(i) Is specifically exempted by a statute that either requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such manner as to leave no discretion on the issue or establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld.</P>
                    <P>(ii) Would reveal the submitter's trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information.</P>
                    <P>(iii) Would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of the submitter's personal privacy.</P>
                    <P>(iv) Would reveal investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes whose disclosure would deprive the submitter of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication.</P>
                    <P>(v) Would reveal investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes whose disclosure would constitute an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of the submitter.</P>
                    <P>
                        (vi) Would reveal investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes when disclosure would interfere with enforcement proceedings or disclose investigative techniques and procedures, 
                        <E T="03">provided,</E>
                         that the claim may be made only by a designated contract market, derivatives clearing organization, swap execution facility, swap data repository or registered futures association with regard to its own investigatory records.
                    </P>
                    <P>(2) The original of any written request for confidential treatment must be sent to the Assistant Secretary of the Commission for FOI, Privacy and Sunshine Acts Compliance. A copy of any request for confidential treatment shall be sent to the Commission division or office receiving the original of any material for which confidential treatment is being sought.</P>
                    <P>(3) A request for confidential treatment shall be clearly marked “FOIA Confidential Treatment Request” and shall contain the name, address, and telephone number of the submitter. The submitter is responsible for informing the Assistant Secretary of the Commission for FOI, Privacy and Sunshine Acts Compliance of any changes in his or her name, address, and telephone number.</P>
                    <P>
                        (4) A request for confidential treatment should accompany the material for which confidential treatment is being sought. If a request for confidential treatment is filed after the filing of such material, the submitter shall have the burden of showing that it was not possible to request confidential treatment for that material at the time the material was filed. A request for confidential treatment of a future submission will not be processed. All records which contain information for which a request for confidential treatment is made or the appropriate segregable portions thereof should be marked by the person submitting the records with a prominent stamp, typed legend, or other suitable form of notice on each page or segregable portion of each page stating “Confidential Treatment Requested by [name].” If such marking is impractical under the circumstances, a cover sheet prominently marked “Confidential Treatment Requested by [name]” should be securely attached to each group of records submitted for which confidential treatment is requested. Each of the records transmitted in this matter should be individually marked with an identifying number and code so that they are separately identifiable. In some circumstances, such as when a person is testifying in the course of a Commission investigation or providing documents requested in the course of a Commission inspection, it may be impractical to submit a written request for confidential treatment at the time the information is first provided to the Commission. In no circumstances can the need to comply with the requirements of this section justify or excuse any delay in submitting information to the Commission. Rather, in such circumstances, the person testifying or otherwise submitting information should inform the Commission employee receiving the information, at the time the information is submitted or as soon thereafter as practicable, that the person is requesting confidential treatment for the information. The person shall then submit a written request for confidential treatment within 
                        <PRTPAGE P="312"/>
                        30 days of the submission of the information. If access is requested under the Freedom of Information Act with respect to material for which no timely request for confidential treatment has been made, it may be presumed that the submitter of the information has waived any interest in asserting that the material is confidential.
                    </P>
                    <P>(5) A request for confidential treatment shall state the length of time for which confidential treatment is being sought.</P>
                    <P>(6) A request for confidential treatment (as distinguishing from the material that is the subject of the request) shall be considered a public document. When a submitter deems it necessary to include, in its request for confidential treatment, information for which it seeks confidential treatment, the submitter shall place that information in an appendix to the request.</P>
                    <P>(7) On 10 business days notice from the Assistant Secretary, a submitter shall submit a detailed written justification of a request for confidential treatment, as specified in paragraph (e) of this section. Upon request and for good cause shown, the Assistant Secretary may grant an extension of such time. The Assistant Secretary will notify the submitter that failure to provide timely a detailed written justification will be deemed a waiver of the submitter's opportunity to appeal an adverse determination.</P>
                    <P>(8)(i) Requests for confidential treatment for any reasonably segregable material that is not exempt from public disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, as implemented in § 145.5, shall be summarily rejected under § 145.9(d)(9). Requests for confidential treatment of public information contained in financial reports as specified in § 1.10 shall not be processed. A submitter has the burden of specifying clearly and precisely the material that is the subject of the confidential treatment request. A submitter may be able to meet this burden in various ways, including:</P>
                    <P>(A) Segregating material for which confidential treatment is being sought;</P>
                    <P>(B) Submitting two copies of the submission: a copy from which material for which confidential treatment is being sought has been obliterated, deleted, or clearly marked and an unmarked copy; and</P>
                    <P>(C) Clearly describing the material within a submission for which confidential treatment is being sought.</P>
                    <P>(ii) A submitter shall not employ a method of specifying the material for which confidential treatment is being sought if that method makes it unduly difficult for the Commission to read the full submission, including all portion claimed to be confidential, in its entirely.</P>
                    <P>(9) If a submitter fails to follow the procedures set forth in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(8) of this section, the Assistant Secretary of the Commission for FOI, Privacy and Sunshine Acts Compliance or his or her designee may summarily reject the submitter's request for confidential treatment with leave to the submitter to refile a proper petition. Failure of the Assistant Secretary or his or her designee summarily to reject a confidential treatment request pursuant to this paragraph shall not be construed to indicate that the submitter has complied with the procedures set forth in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(8) of this section.</P>
                    <P>(10) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(9) of this section, no determination with respect to any request for confidential treatment will be made until the Commission receives a Freedom of Information Act request for the material for which confidential treatment is being sought.</P>
                    <P>
                        (e) 
                        <E T="03">Detailed written justification of request for confidential treatment.</E>
                         (1) If the Assistant Secretary or his or her designee determines that a FOIA request seeks material for which confidential treatment has been requested pursuant to § 145.9, the Assistant Secretary or his or her designee shall require the submitter to file a detailed written justification of the confidential request within ten business days (unless under § 145.9(d)(7) an extension of time has been granted) of that determination unless, pursuant to an earlier FOIA request, a prior determination to release or withhold the material has been made, the submitter has already provided sufficient information to grant the request for confidential treatment; 
                        <PRTPAGE P="313"/>
                        or the material is otherwise in the public domain. The detailed written justification shall be filed with the Assistant Secretary of the Commission for FOI, Privacy and Sunshine Acts Compliance. It shall be clearly marked “Detailed Written Justification of FOIA Confidential Treatment Request” and shall contain the request number supplied by the Commission. The submitter shall also send a copy of the detailed written justification to the FOIA requester at the address specified by the Commission.
                    </P>
                    <P>(2) The period for filing a detailed written justification may be extended upon request and for good cause shown.</P>
                    <P>(3) The detailed written justification of the confidential treatment request shall contain:</P>
                    <P>(i) The reasons, referring to the specific exemptive provisions of the Freedom of Information Act listed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, why the information that is the subject of the FOIA request should be withheld from access under the Freedom of Information Act;</P>
                    <P>(ii) The applicability of any specific statutory or regulatory provisions that govern or may govern the treatment of the information;</P>
                    <P>(iii) The existence and applicability of prior determinations by the Commission, other federal agencies, or courts concerning the specific exemptive provisions of the Freedom of Information Act pursuant to which confidential treatment is being requested. Submitters shall satisfy any evidentiary burdens imposed upon them by applicable Freedom of Information Act case law.</P>
                    <P>(iv) Such additional facts and authorities as the submitter may consider appropriate.</P>
                    <P>(4) The detailed written justification of a confidential treatment request shall be accompanied by affidavits to the extent necessary to establish the facts necessary to satisfy the submitter's evidentiary burden.</P>
                    <P>(5) The detailed written justification of a confidential treatment request (as distinguished from the material that is the subject of the request) shall be considered a public document. However, a submitter will be permitted to submit to the Commission supplementary confidential affidavits with his or her detailed written justification if that is the only way in which he or she can convincingly demonstrate that the material that is the subject of the confidential treatment request should not be disclosed to the FOIA requester.</P>
                    <P>
                        (f) 
                        <E T="03">Initial determination with respect to petition for confidential treatment.</E>
                         (1) The Assistant Secretary for FOI, Privacy and Sunshine Acts Compliance or his or her designee, in consultation with the Office in which the record was located, shall issue an initial determination with respect to a confidential treatment request for material that is responsive to the FOIA request. This determination shall be issued at the same time as the initial determination with respect to the FOIA request. 
                        <E T="03">See</E>
                         § 145.7(g). To the extent that the initial determination grants a confidential treatment request in full or in part, it should specify the FOIA exemptions upon which this determination is based and briefly describe the material to which each exemption applies. 
                        <E T="03">See</E>
                         § 145.7(g)(2). To the extent that the initial determination denies confidential treatment to any material for which confidential treatment was requested, it should briefly describe the material for which confidential treatment is denied.
                    </P>
                    <P>(2) If the Assistant Secretary or his or her designee determines that a confidential treatment request shall be denied in full or in part, the submitter shall be informed of his or her right to appeal to the Commission's General Counsel in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (g) of this section. The material for which confidential treatment was denied shall be released to the FOIA requester if the submitter does not file an appeal within 10 business days of the date on which his or her request was denied.</P>
                    <P>
                        (3) If the Assistant Secretary or his or her designee determines that a confidential treatment request shall be granted in full or in part, the FOIA requester shall be informed of his or her right to appeal to the Commission's General Counsel in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 145.7(h).

                        <E T="03">Appeal from initial determination that confidential treatment is not warranted.</E>
                         (1) An appeal from an initial determination to deny a confidential treatment request in full or in part shall be filed with the General Counsel of the Commission. No disclosure of the material that is the subject of the appeal shall be made until the appeal is resolved. If both a submitter and a FOIA requester appeal to the General Counsel from a partial grant and partial denial of a confidential treatment request, those appeals shall be consolidated.
                    </P>
                    <P>(2) Any appeal of a denial of a request for confidential treatment shall be in writing, and shall be clearly marked “FOIA Confidential Treatment Appeal.” The appeal shall include a copy of the initial determination and shall clearly indicate the portions of the initial determination from which an appeal is being taken.</P>
                    <P>(3) The appeal shall be sent to the Commission's Office of General Counsel. A copy of the appeal shall be sent to the FOIA requester. The General Counsel or his or her designee shall have the authority to consider all appeals from initial determinations of the Assistant Secretary of the Commission for FOI, Privacy and Sunshine Acts compliance. The General Counsel may, in his sole and unfettered discretion, refer such appeals and questions concerning stays under paragraph (g)(10) of this section to the Commission for decision.</P>
                    <P>(4) In the appeal, the submitter may supply additional substantiation for his or her request for confidential treatment, including additional affidavits and additional legal argument. Such submissions shall be governed by paragraph (e)(5) of this section.</P>
                    <P>(5) The FOIA requester shall have an opportunity to respond in writing to the appeal within 10 business days of the date of filing of the FOIA Confidential Treatment Appeal. The FOIA requester need not respond, however. Any response shall be sent to the Commission's Office of General Counsel. A copy shall be sent to the submitter.</P>
                    <P>(6) All FOIA Confidential Treatment Appeals and all responses thereto shall be considered public documents.</P>
                    <P>(7) The General Counsel will make a determination with respect to any appeal within twenty business days after receipt by the Office of General Counsel of such appeal or within such extended period as may be permitted in accordance with the standards set forth in § 145.7(g)(3). Although other procedures may be employed, to the extent possible the General Counsel will decide the appeal on the basis of the affidavits and other documentary evidence submitted by the submitter and the FOIA requests.</P>
                    <P>(8) The General Counsel or his or her designee shall have the authority to remand any matter to the Assistant Secretary of the Commission for FOI, Privacy and Sunshine Acts Compliance to correct deficiencies in the initial processing of the confidential treatment request.</P>
                    <P>(9) If the General Counsel or his or her designee denies a confidential treatment appeal in full or in part, the information for which confidential treatment is denied shall be disclosed to the FOIA requester 10 business days later, subject to any stay entered pursuant to paragraph (g)(10) of this section.</P>
                    <P>(10) The General Counsel or his or here designee shall have the authority to enter and vacate stays as set forth below. If, within 10 business days of the date of issuance of a determination by the General Counsel or his or her designee to disclose information for which a submitter sought confidential treatment, the submitter commences an action in federal court concerning that determination, the General Counsel will stay the public disclosure of the information pending final judicial resolution of the matter. The General Counsel or his or her designee may vacate a stay entered under this section, either on his or her own motion or at the request of the FOIA requester. If such a stay is vacated, the information will be released to the requester 10 business days after the submitter is notified of this action, unless a court orders otherwise.</P>

                         The following charges may be made where applicable for responding to requests for records.
                    </P>

                    <P>(3) When searches require the expertise of a computer specialist, staff time for programming and performing searches will be charged at $10.25 per quarter hour. For searches of records stored on personal computers used as workstations by Commission staff and shared access network servers, the computer processing time is included in the search time for the staff member using the workstation as set forth in paragraph (a) of this appendix.</P>
                    <P>(4) Document duplication, including computer printouts, will be charged at $0.15 per page.</P>
                    <P>(5) For copies of materials other than paper records, the requester will be charged the actual cost of materials and reproduction, including the time of clerical personnel at a rate of $4.75 per quarter hour.</P>
                    <P>(6) When a request has been made and granted to examine Commission records at an office of the Commission other than the office in which the records are routinely maintained, the requester:</P>
                    <P>(i) Will reimburse the Commission for the actual cost of transporting the records; and</P>
                    <P>(ii) Will be charged at a rate of $4.75 for each quarter hour spent by clerical personnel in preparing the records for transit.</P>
                    <P>(7) For certifying that requested records are true copies, the charge will be $3.00 per certification.</P>
                    <P>(8) Upon request, records will be mailed by means of overnight or express mail at the fee of $10.00 per package mailed.</P>

                         Fees will be waived or reduced by the Commission if:
                    </P>
                    <P>(1) The fee is less than or equal to $10.00, the approximate cost to the Commission of collecting the fee; or,</P>
                    <P>(2) If the Commission determines that the disclosure of the information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.</P>
                    <P>
                        (c) 
                        <E T="03">Applicability of fees.</E>
                         Fees shall be charged even if no records are ultimately furnished to the requester. Fees apply to various types of requests as follows.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        (1) 
                        <E T="03">Commercial use request.</E>
                         Fees for search time, review time and duplication of records will be charged to requests from or on behalf of one who seeks information for a user or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        (2) 
                        <E T="03">Educational institution or noncommercial scientific institution.</E>
                         Only duplication fees will be charged to schools or to organizations which operate solely for the purpose of scientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. No charge will be made for the first 100 pages duplicated or for search or review time.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        (3) 
                        <E T="03">Representative of the news media.</E>
                         Only duplication fees will be charged to any person actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public. No charge will be made for the first 100 pages duplicated or for search or review time.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        (4) 
                        <E T="03">Other requesters.</E>
                         Fees for search time and duplication will be charged to requesters who are not covered by one of the categories above. No charge will be made for the first two hours of search time, the first 100 pages of duplication, or for review time. If the search is for records stored in a computer format, a combination of computer operation charges and search time charges will be waived up to the equivalent of two hours of professional search time.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        (d) 
                        <E T="03">Aggregation of requests.</E>
                         For purposes of determining fees, the Commission may aggregate reasonably related requests if multiple requests are made within a 30-day period or if there is a solid basis for believing that multiple requests were made solely to avoid fees.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        (e) 
                        <E T="03">Notification of fees.</E>
                         A request for Commission records may state that the party is willing to pay fees up to a stated limit for services to be provided in searching, reviewing and duplicating requested records. If such a statement is made, no work will be done that will result in fees beyond the stated limit without written authorization. If no limit is stated, no work will be done that will result in fees in excess of $25.00 without written authorization from the requester.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        (f) 
                        <E T="03">Advance payment of fees.</E>
                         The Commission may request advance payment of all or part of the fee (i) when fees are expected to exceed $250; or (ii) when a requester has previously failed to pay fees in a timely fashion.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        (g) 
                        <E T="03">Payment of fees.</E>
                         Payment should be made by check or money order payable to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        (h) 
                        <E T="03">Interest on fees.</E>
                         The Commission will begin charging interest on unpaid bills starting on the 31th day following the day on which the bill was sent. Interest will be at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717.

                         If fees not paid, the Commission may disclose debts to appropriate authorities for collection or to consumer reporting agencies.

                    <P>(a) This part contains the rules of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission implementing the Privacy Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93-579, 5 U.S.C. 552a). These rules apply to all records maintained by this Commission which are not excepted or exempted as set forth in § 146.12, insofar as they contain personal information concerning an individual, identify that individual by name or other symbol and are contained in a system of records from which information is retrieved by the individual's name or identifying symbol. Among the primary purposes of these rules are to permit individuals to determine whether information about them is contained in Commission files and, if so, to obtain access to that information; to establish procedures whereby individuals may have inaccurate and incomplete information corrected; and, to restrict access by unauthorized persons to that information.</P>
                    <P>(b) In this part the Commission is also exempting certain Commission systems of records from some of the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 that would otherwise be applicable to those systems. These exemptions are authorized under the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(k).</P>

                    <P>(d) Assistance in preparing a request to amend a record may be obtained from the FOI, Privacy and Sunshine Acts compliance staff, Office of the Secretariat, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW., Washington, DC 20581.</P>
                    <P>(e) Upon receipt of a request for amendment the Executive Director of the Commission or a person designated by the Executive Director shall promptly determine whether the record is materially inaccurate, incomplete, misleading, or is irrelevant or not timely, as claimed by the individual, and, if so, shall cause the record to be amended in accordance with the individual's request.</P>
                    <P>
                        (f) If the Executive Director or designee grants the request to amend the record, the individual shall promptly be advised of the decision and of the action taken, and notice shall be given of the correction and its substance to each person or agency to whom the record had previously been disclosed, as shown on the record of disclosures maintained in accordance with § 146.6(c).

The individual shall also be notified of the procedures for administrative review by the Commission of any complete or partial denial of a request for amendment, which are set forth in § 146.9.</P>
                    <P>(h) If a request is received for amendment of a record prepared by another agency which is in the possession or control of the Commission, the request for amendment will be forwarded to that agency. If that agency determines that the correction should be made, the Commission will amend its records accordingly and notify the individual making the request for amendment of the change. If the other agency declines to make the amendment, the Executive Director or designee will independently determine whether the amendment will be made to the record in the Commission's possession or control, considering any explanation given by the other agency for its decision.</P>

                        (a) Investigatory materials compiled for law enforcement purposes are exempt from portions of the Privacy Act of 1974 and of these rules as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, on the basis and to the extent that individual access to these files could impair the effectiveness and orderly conduct of the Commission's regulatory and enforcement program. Materials exempted under this paragraph are contained in the system of records entitled “Exempted Investigatory Records” and/or in the system of records entitled “Exempted Closed Commission Meetings.” 
                        <PRTPAGE P="325"/>
                        Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, no record which has served as a basis for denying an individual a right, privilege, or benefit to which he would otherwise be eligible, shall be maintained in this system, unless the disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, or, prior to the effective date of this section, under an implied promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence. For records of this type, if practicable, material identifying the confidential source shall be extracted or summarized in a manner which protects the source and the summary or extract shall be maintained in a comparable nonexempted system of records.
                    </P>
                    <P>(b) Investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for employment with the Commission are exempt from portions of the Privacy Act of 1974 and of these rules as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, to the extent that it identifies a confidential source. This is done in order to encourage persons from whom information is sought to provide information to the Commission which, absent assurances of confidentiality, they would be unwilling to give. However, if practicable, material identifying a confidential source shall be extracted or summarized in a manner which protects the source and the summary or extract shall be maintained in a non-exempt system containing the same category of record. Materials exempted under this paragraph are included in the system of records entitled “Exempted Employee Background Investigation Material” and/or in the system of records entitled “Exempted Closed Commission Meetings.”</P>

                        <P>The Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504 (called “the Act” in this part), provides for the award of attorney fees and other expenses to eligible individuals and entities who are prevailing private parties in adjudicatory proceedings before the Commission. An eligible party may receive an award when it prevails over the Commission, unless the Commission's position was substantially justified or special circumstances make an award unjust. The rules in this part describe the parties eligible for awards and the proceedings that are covered. They also explain how to apply for awards, and the procedures and standards that the Commission will use to make them.</P>

                        <P>
                            (a) The Act applies to adjudicatory proceedings conducted by the Commission. These are adjudications under 5 U.S.C. 554 in which the position of the Commission or any other agency of the United States, or any component of an agency, is presented by an attorney or other representative who enters an appearance and participates in the proceeding. Reparation proceedings under section 14 of the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. 18, Commission review of exchange disciplinary and access denial actions under section 8c of the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. 12c, and registered futures association disciplinary and membership denial actions under section 17 of the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. 21, are not covered by the Act. Proceedings brought to determine whether or not to grant or renew registrations pursuant to sections 8a or 17(
                            <E T="03">o</E>
                            ), of the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. 8, 12a and 21(

                            ), or contract market designations pursuant to section 6(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. 8 (a), are excluded, but proceedings brought to suspend or revoke registrations or contract market designations are covered if they are otherwise adjudicatory proceedings. For the Commission, the types of proceedings generally covered are adjudicatory proceedings as defined in § 10.2(b) of this chapter; part 14 proceedings, if they involve a hearing, are also covered.
                        </P>
                        <P>(b) The Commission's decision not to identify a type of proceeding as an adversary adjudication shall not preclude the filing of an application by a party who believes the proceeding is covered by the Act; whether the proceeding is covered will then be an issue for resolution in the proceedings on the application.</P>
                        <P>(c) If a proceeding includes both matters covered by the Act and matters specifically excluded from coverage, any award made will include only fees and expenses related to covered issues.</P>

                        <SUBJECT>Eligibility of applicants.</SUBJECT>
                        <P>(a) To be eligible for an award of attorney fees and other expenses under the Act, the applicant must be a party to the adjudicatory proceeding for which it seeks an award. The term “party” is defined in 5 U.S.C. 551(3). The applicant must show that it meets all conditions of eligibility set out in this subpart and in subpart B.</P>
                        <P>(b) The types of eligible applicants are as follows:</P>
                        <P>(1) An individual with a net worth of not more than $2 million;</P>
                        <P>(2) The sole owner of an unincorporated business who has a net worth of not more than $7 million, including both personal and business interests, and not more that 500 employees;</P>
                        <P>(3) A charitable or other tax-exempt organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) with not more than 500 employees;</P>
                        <P>(4) A cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)) with not more than 500 employees; and</P>
                        <P>(5) Any other partnership, corporation, association, unit of local government, or public or private organization with a net worth of not more than $7 million and not more than 500 employees.</P>
                        <P>(c) For the purpose of eligibility, the net worth and number of employees of an applicant shall be determined as of the date the adjudicatory proceeding was initiated.</P>
                        <P>(d) An applicant who owns an unincorporated business will be considered as an “individual” rather than a “sole owner of an unincorporated business” if the issues on which the applicant prevails are related primarily to personal interests rather than to business interests.</P>
                        <P>
                            (e) The employees of an applicant include all persons who regularly perform services for compensation for the applicant, under the applicant's direction and control. The term “employee” also embraces all the agents of an applicant, by whatever title or label they may be known, for whose acts or omissions the applicant may be held liable under the Commodity Exchange Act.

                        <P>(f) The net worth and number of employees of the applicant and all of its affiliates shall be aggregated to determine eligibility. Any individual, corporation or other entity that directly or indirectly controls or owns a majority of the voting shares or other interest of the applicant, or any corporation or other entity of which the applicant directly or indirectly owns or controls a majority of the voting shares or other interest, will be considered an affiliate for purposes of this part, unless the Presiding Officer determines that such treatment would be unjust and contrary to the purposes of the Act in light of the actual relationship between the affiliated entities. In addition, the Presiding Officer may determine that financial relationships of the applicant other than those described in this paragraph constitute special circumstances that would make an award unjust.</P>
                        <P>(g) An applicant that participates in a proceeding on behalf of one or more other persons or entitles that would be ineligible is not itself eligible for an award.</P>

                        <P>(a) A prevailing applicant may receive an award for fees and expenses incurred in connection with an adjudicatory proceeding, or in a significant and discrete substantive portion of the proceeding, unless the position of the Commission was substantially justified. The position of the Commission includes, in addition to the position taken by the Commission in the adversary adjudication, the action or failure to act by the Commission upon which the adversary adjudication is based. The burden of proof that an award should not be made to an eligible prevailing applicant is on the Commission.</P>
                        <P>(b) An award will be reduced or denied if the applicant has unduly or unreasonably protracted the adjudicatory proceeding or if special circumstances make the award sought unjust.</P>

                        <SUBJECT>Allowable fees and expenses.</SUBJECT>
                        <P>(a) Awards will be based on rates customarily charged by persons engaged in the business of acting as attorneys, agents and expert witnesses, even if the services were made available without charge or at a reduced rate to the applicant.</P>
                        <P>(b) No award for the fee of an attorney or agent under these rules may exceed $75 per hour. No award to compensate an expert witness may exceed the maximum daily rate prescribed for GS-18 under section 5332 of title 5 of the U.S. Code. However, an award may also include the reasonable expenses of the attorney, agent, or witness as a separate item, if the attorney, agent or witness ordinarily charges clients separately for such expenses.</P>
                        <P>(c) In determining the reasonableness of the fee sought for an attorney, agent or expert witness, the Presiding Officer shall consider the following:</P>
                        <P>(1) If the attorney, agent or witness is in private practice, his or her customary fee for similar services, or, if an employee of the applicant, the fully allocated cost of the services;</P>
                        <P>(2) The prevailing rate for similar services in the community in which the attorney, agent or witness ordinarily performs services;</P>
                        <P>(3) The time actually spent in the representation of the applicant;</P>
                        <P>(4) The time reasonably spent in light of the difficulty or complexity of the issues in the adjudicatory proceeding; and</P>
                        <P>(5) Such other factors as may bear on the value of the services provided.</P>
                        <P>(d) The reasonable cost of any study, analysis, test, project or similar matter prepared on behalf of a party may be awarded, to the extent that the charge for the service does not exceed the prevailing rate for similar services, and the study or other matter was necessary for preparation of the applicant's case.</P>

                        <P>(a) If warranted by an increase in the cost of living or by special circumstances (such as limited availability of attorneys qualified to handle certain types of proceedings), the Commission may adopt regulations providing that attorney fees may be awarded at a rate higher than $75 per hour in some or all of the types of proceedings covered by this part. The Commission will conduct any rulemaking proceedings for this purpose under the informal rulemaking procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553.</P>

                        <P>(2) It states that it is a cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)).</P>
                        <P>(c) The application shall state the amount of fees and expenses for which an award is sought.</P>

The exhibit may be in any form convenient to the applicant that provides full disclosure of the applicant's and its affiliates' assets and liabilities and is sufficient to determine whether the applicant qualifies under the standards in this part. The Presiding Officer may require an applicant to file additional information to determine its eligibility for an award.</P>

The motion shall describe the information sought to be withheld and explain, in detail, why it falls within one or more of the specific exemptions from mandatory disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1)-(9), why public disclosure of the information would adversely affect the applicant, and why disclosure is not required in the public interest. The material in question shall be served on counsel representing the Commission or other agency against which the applicant seeks an award, but need not be served on any other party to the adjudicatory proceeding. If the Presiding Officer finds that the information should not be withheld from disclosure, it shall be placed in the public record of the adjudicatory proceeding. Otherwise, any request to inspect or copy the exhibit shall be disposed of in accordance with the Commission's established procedures under the Freedom of Information Act as provided in part 145 of this chapter. For that purpose, the applicant shall file a copy of its motion with the Commission's Freedom of Information Act Compliance Staff in the Office of the Secretariat, Washington, DC.

                        <SUBJECT>Appeal to the Commission.</SUBJECT>
                        <P>(a) Either the applicant or counsel for the Commission or for another relevant agency may appeal the initial decision on the fee application by complying with the requirements of this section. An appealing party shall serve upon opposing parties and shall file with the Proceedings Clerk a notice of appeal within fifteen (15) days after service of the initial decision. The notice need consist only of a brief statement indicating the filing party's intent to appeal the initial decision, and shall include the date upon which the initial decision was rendered, the name of the proceeding, and the docket number of the proceeding. The failure of a party timely to file and serve a notice of appeal in accordance with this paragraph, or to perfect the appeal in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, shall constitute a voluntary waiver of any objection to the initial decision, and of all further administrative or judicial review under these rules and the Equal Access to Justice Act.</P>
                        <P>(b) An appeal shall be perfected by the appealing party by timely filing with the Proceedings Clerk an appeal brief which meets the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section. An original and one copy of the appeal brief shall be filed within thirty (30) days after filing of the notice of appeal. By motion of the appealing party, the Commission may, for good cause shown, extend the time for filing the appeal brief. If the appeal brief is not filed within the time prescribed in this subparagraph, the Commission may, upon its own motion or upon motion by a party, dismiss the appeal, in which event the initial decision shall become the final decision and order of the Commission, effective upon service of the order of dismissal.</P>
                        <P>(c) The opposing party may, within thirty (30) days after service of the appeal brief, file an original and one copy of an answering brief, and serve one copy thereof, unless the time limit is extended by the Commission upon motion of the party and for good cause shown.</P>
                        <P>(d) Parties filing an appeal brief or answering brief shall meet the requirements of § 10.12 of this chapter as to form. The content of briefs shall satisfy the requirements of § 10.102(d) of this chapter, except that any party, with leave of the Commission, may file an informal document in lieu of a brief. No brief shall exceed thirty-five (35) pages in length without advance leave of the Commission.</P>
                        <P>
                            (e) On review, the Commission may, in its discretion, consider

                             any issues arising from the record and may base its determination thereon, or limit the issues to those presented in the statement of issues in the briefs, treating those issues not raised as waived.

The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

                         The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.

                         In meeting the requirements of § 149.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to handicapped persons. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 149.150(a)(2) or (a)(3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—

The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written).

If such person submits an application to a designated contract market or swap execution facility in accordance with this section, and the designated contract market or swap execution facility, with respect to its own speculative position limits established pursuant to § 150.5(a), recognizes the person's position as a non-enumerated bona fide hedging transaction or position, then the person may also exceed the applicable Federal speculative position limit for such position in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section. The designated contract market or swap execution facility may approve such applications only if the designated contract market or swap execution facility complies with the conditions set forth in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.</P>

                    <P>(2) The position meets the definition of bona fide hedging transaction or position in section 4a(c)(2) of the Act and the definition of bona fide hedging transaction or position in § 150.1; and</P>

                         (i) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, the designated contract market or swap execution facility requires the applicant to submit an application and receive a notice of approval of such application from the designated contract market or swap execution facility prior to the date that the position for which such application was submitted would be in excess of the applicable Federal speculative position limits.
                    </P>

                    <P>(A) The designated contract market or swap execution facility must require that any application filed pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section include an explanation of the circumstances warranting the sudden or unforeseen increases in bona fide hedging needs.</P>

                    <P>(C) The Commission will not pursue an enforcement action for a position limits violation for the person holding the position during the period of the designated contract market, swap execution facility, or Commission's review nor once a determination has been issued, so long as the application was submitted in good faith and the person complies with paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.</P>

                         The designated contract market or swap execution facility requires each applicant to reapply with the designated contract market or swap execution facility to maintain such recognition at least on an annual basis by updating the initial application, and to receive a notice of extension of the original approval from the designated contract market or swap execution facility to continue relying on such recognition for purposes of Federal speculative position limits. If the facts and circumstances underlying a renewal application are materially different than the initial application, the designated contract market or swap execution facility is required to treat such application as a new request submitted through the § 150.9 process and subject to the Commission's 10/2-day review process in paragraph (e) of this section.

                         The regulations governing exchange-set speculative position limits and exemptions therefrom under § 150.5(a)(2)(ii)(D) provide that designated contract markets and swap execution facilities (“exchanges”) may impose restrictions on bona fide hedging transaction or position exemptions to require the person to exit any such positions in excess of limits during the lesser of the last five days of trading or the time period for the spot month in such physical-delivery contract, or otherwise limit the size of such position. This guidance is intended to provide factors the Commission believes exchanges should consider when determining whether to impose a five-day rule or similar restriction but is not intended to be used as a mandatory checklist. The exchanges may consider whether:

                    <P>This appendix C provides guidance regarding the “referenced contract” definition in § 150.1, which provides in paragraph (3) of the definition of referenced contract that the term referenced contract does not include a location basis contract, a commodity index contract, a swap guarantee, a trade option that meets the requirements of § 32.3 of this chapter, a monthly average pricing contract, or an outright price reporting agency index contract. The term “referenced contract” is used throughout part 150 of the Commission's regulations to refer to contracts that are subject to Federal position limits. A position in a contract that is not a referenced contract is not subject to Federal position limits, and, as a consequence, cannot be netted with positions in referenced contracts for purposes of Federal position limits. This guidance is intended to clarify the types of contracts that would qualify as a location basis contract, commodity index contract, monthly average pricing contract, or outright price reporting agency index contract.</P>
                    <P>Compliance with this guidance does not diminish or replace, in any event, the obligations and requirements of any person to comply with the regulations provided under this part, or any other part of the Commission's regulations. The guidance is for illustrative purposes only and does not state the exclusive means for a contract to qualify, or not qualify, as a referenced contract as defined in § 150.1, or to comply with any other provision in this part.</P>

                         For purposes of the referenced contract definition in § 150.1, a location basis contract means a commodity derivative contract that is cash-settled based on the difference in:

                    <P>(A) A commodity deliverable on the same particular core referenced futures contract, whether at par, a fixed discount to par, or a premium to par; or</P>

                         For purposes of the referenced contract definition in § 150.1, a commodity index contract means an agreement, contract, or transaction that is based on an index comprised of prices of commodities that are not the same or substantially the same, and that is not a location basis contract, a calendar spread contract, or an intercommodity spread contract as such terms are defined in this guidance, where:
                    </P>
                    <P>(i) A calendar spread contract means a cash-settled agreement, contract, or transaction that represents the difference between the settlement price in one or a series of contract months of an agreement, contract, or transaction and the settlement price of another contract month or another series of contract months' settlement prices for the same agreement, contract, or transaction; and</P>
                    <P>(ii) An intercommodity spread contract means a cash-settled agreement, contract, or transaction that represents the difference between the settlement price of a referenced contract and the settlement price of another contract, agreement, or transaction that is based on a different commodity.</P>

                    <P>
                        (i) The contract's price is calculated based on the equally-weighted arithmetic average

                        of the daily prices of the underlying referenced contract for the entire corresponding calendar month or trade month, as applicable; or
                    </P>
                    <P>(ii) In determining the price of such contract, the component daily prices, in the aggregate, during the spot month of the underlying referenced contract comprise no more than 40 percent of such contract's weighting.</P>

                         that this term does not include any commodity derivative contract that settles at a basis, or differential, between a referenced contract and a price reporting agency index.

Exchanges and market participants may also consider this guidance for purposes of spread transaction exemptions granted pursuant to § 150.5(b).

                    <P>(i) Collect sufficient information from the market participant to be able to:</P>

                    <P>(iii) A spread transaction between a physically-settled contract and a cash-settled contract;</P>

                         The spread transaction definition in § 150.1 would permit transactions commonly known as “cash-and-carry” trades whereby a market participant enters a long futures position in the spot month and an equivalent short futures position in the following month, in order to guarantee a return that, at minimum, covers the costs of its carrying charges, 
                        <E T="03">such as</E>
                         the cost of financing, insuring, and storing the physical inventory until the next expiration (including insurance, storage fees, and financing costs, as well as other costs such as aging discounts that are specific to individual commodities). With this exemption, the market participant is able to take physical delivery of the product in the nearby month and may redeliver the same product in a deferred month. When determining whether to grant, and when monitoring, cash-and-carry spread transaction exemptions, the exchange should consider:

                    <P>(d) Prohibit such member from disclosing at any time that he is holding an order of another person or from divulging any order revealed to him by reason of his relationship to such other person, except pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section or at the request of an authorized representative of the Commission or the contract market.</P>
                    <P>(e) Prohibit such member from taking, directly or indirectly, the other side of any order of another person revealed to him by reason of his relationship to such other person, except with such other person's prior consent and in conformity with contract market rules approved by the Commission.</P>

                        <P>(1) The customer uses your web site to access financial products and services electronically and agrees to receive notices at the web site and you post your current privacy notice continuously in a clear and conspicuous manner on the web site; or</P>

                        <P>(a) The model form may be used, at the option of a financial institution, including a group of financial institutions that use a common privacy notice, to meet the content requirements of the privacy notice and opt-out notice set forth in §§ 160.6 and 160.7 of this part.</P>
                        <P>(b) The model form is a standardized form, including page layout, content, format, style, pagination, and shading. Institutions seeking to obtain the safe harbor through use of the model form may modify it only as described in these Instructions.</P>
                        <P>(c) Note that disclosure of certain information, such as assets, income, and information from a consumer reporting agency, may give rise to obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act [15 U.S.C. 1681-1681x] (FCRA), such as a requirement to permit a consumer to opt out of disclosures to affiliates or designation as a consumer reporting agency if disclosures are made to nonaffiliated third parties.</P>
                        <P>(d) The word “customer” may be replaced by the word “member” whenever it appears in the model form, as appropriate.</P>

                             The model form must be printed on white or light color paper (such as cream) with black or other contrasting ink color.

Only the sixth row (“For our affiliates to market to you”) may be omitted at the option of the institution.

Institutions may include the words “toll-free” before telephone, as appropriate. An institution that allows consumers to opt out online must provide either a specific Web address that takes consumers directly to the opt-out page or a general Web address that provides a clear and conspicuous direct link to the opt-out page. The opt-out choices made available to the consumer who contacts the institution through these methods must correspond accurately to the “Yes” responses in the third column of the disclosure table. In the part titled “Please note” institutions may insert a number that is 30 or greater in the space marked “[30].” Instructions on voluntary or state privacy law opt-out information are in paragraph C.2(g)(5) of these Instructions.

This includes institutions that require customers with multiple accounts to identify each account to which the opt-out should apply. An institution must enter its opt-out mailing address: in the far right of this form (

                             Institutions must use five (5) of the following terms to complete the bulleted list for this question: Open an account; deposit money; pay your bills; apply for a loan; use your credit or debit card; seek financial or tax advice; apply for insurance; pay insurance premiums; file an insurance claim; seek advice about your investments; buy securities from us; sell securities to us; direct us to buy securities; direct us to sell your securities; make deposits or withdrawals from your account; enter into an investment advisory contract; give us your income information; provide employment information; give us your employment history; tell us about your investment or retirement portfolio; tell us about your investment or retirement earnings; apply for financing; apply for a lease; provide account information; give us your contact information; pay us by check; give us your wage statements; provide your mortgage information; make a wire transfer; tell us who receives the money; tell us where to send the money; show your government-issued ID; show your driver's license; order a commodity futures or option trade. Institutions that collect personal information from their affiliates and/or credit bureaus must include after the bulleted list the following statement: “We also collect your personal information from others, such as credit bureaus, affiliates, or other companies.” Institutions that do not collect personal information from their affiliates or credit bureaus but do collect information from other companies must include the following statement instead: “We also collect your personal information from other companies.” Only institutions that do not collect any personal information from affiliates, credit bureaus, or other companies can omit both statements.

The new opt-out notice must apply, at a minimum, to eligibility information obtained in connection with the new continuing relationship. Consistent with paragraph b of this section, the consumer's decision not to opt out after receiving the new opt-out notice would not override a prior opt-out election by the consumer that applies to eligibility information obtained in connection with a terminated relationship, regardless of whether the new opt-out notice applies to eligibility information obtained in connection with the terminated relationship.

                             Since the FCRA provides that opt-out elections can expire in a period of no less than five years, an affiliate that has or previously had a pre-existing business relationship with a consumer must provide a renewal notice to the consumer after such time in order to allow its affiliates to make solicitations. After the opt-out election period expires, its affiliates may make solicitations unless:

                             This section applies to a person described in § 162.30(a) that issues a debit or credit card (card issuer).

                            <E T="03">Definition of cardholder.</E>
                             For purposes of this section, a cardholder means a consumer who has been issued a credit or debit card.
                        </P>

                            <E T="03">Address validation requirements.</E>
                             A card issuer must establish and implement reasonable policies and procedures to assess the validity of a change of address if it receives notification of a change of address for a consumer's debit or credit card account and, within a short period of time afterwards (during at least the first 30 days after it receives such notification), the card issuer receives a request for an additional or replacement card for the same account. Under these circumstances, the card issuer may not issue an additional or replacement card, until, in accordance with its reasonable policies and procedures and for the purpose of assessing the validity of the change of address, the card issuer:
                        </P>
                        <P>(1)(i) Notifies the cardholder of the request:</P>
                        <P>(A) At the cardholder's former address; or</P>
                        <P>(B) By any other means of communication that the card issuer and the cardholder have previously agreed to use; and</P>
                        <P>(ii) Provides to the cardholder a reasonable means of promptly reporting incorrect address changes; or</P>
                        <P>(2) Otherwise assesses the validity of the change of address in accordance with the policies and procedures the card issuer has established pursuant to § 162.30.</P>
                        <P>
                            (d) 
                            <E T="03">Alternative timing of address validation.</E>
                             A card issuer may satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section if it validates an address pursuant to the methods in paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section when it receives an address change notification, before it receives a request for an additional or replacement card.
                        </P>

                             Any written or electronic notice that the card issuer provides under this paragraph must be clear and conspicuous and provided separately from its regular correspondence with the cardholder.

                        <P>A. Although use of the model forms is not required, use of the model forms in this appendix (as applicable) complies with the requirement in section 624 of the FCRA for clear, conspicuous, and concise notices.</P>
                        <P>B. Certain changes may be made to the language or format of the model forms without losing the protection from liability afforded by use of the model forms. These changes may not be so extensive as to affect the substance, clarity, or meaningful sequence of the language in the model forms. Persons making such extensive revisions will lose the safe harbor that this appendix provides. Acceptable changes include, for example:</P>
                        <P>1. Rearranging the order of the references to “your income”, “your account history”, and “your credit score”.</P>
                        <P>2. Substituting other types of information for “income”, “account history”, or “credit score” for accuracy, such as “payment history”, “credit history”, or “claims history”.</P>
                        <P>3. Substituting a clearer and more accurate description of the affiliates providing or covered by the notice for phrases such as “the [ABC] group of companies,” including without limitation a statement that the entity providing the notice recently purchased the consumer's account.</P>
                        <P>4. Substituting other types of affiliates covered by the notice for “commodity advisor”, “futures clearing merchant”, or “swap dealer” affiliates.</P>
                        <P>5. Omitting items that are not accurate or applicable. For example, if a person does not limit the duration of the opt-out period, the notice may omit information about the renewal notice.</P>
                        <P>6. Adding a statement informing consumers how much time they have to opt out before shared eligibility information may be used to make solicitations to them.</P>
                        <P>7. Adding a statement that the consumer may exercise the right to opt out at any time.</P>
                        <P>8. Adding the following statement, if accurate: “If you previously opted out, you do not need to do so again.”</P>
                        <P>9. Providing a place on the form for the consumer to fill in identifying information, such as his or her name and address.</P>

                        <P>The Identity Theft Prevention Program's policies and procedures should address the detection of Red Flags in connection with the opening of covered accounts and existing covered accounts, such as by:</P>
                        <P>(a) Obtaining identifying information about, and verifying the identity of, a person opening a covered account; and</P>

                        <P>The Identity Theft Prevention Program's policies and procedures should provide for appropriate responses to the Red Flags the financial institution or creditor has detected that are commensurate with the degree of risk posed. In determining an appropriate response, a financial institution or creditor should consider aggravating factors that may heighten the risk of identity theft, such as a data security incident that results in unauthorized access to a customer's account records held by the financial institution or creditor, or third party, or notice that a customer has provided information related to a covered account held by the financial institution or creditor to someone fraudulently claiming to represent the financial institution or creditor or to a fraudulent Internet Web site. Appropriate responses may include the following:</P>
                        <P>(a) Monitoring a covered account for evidence of identity theft;</P>
                        <P>(b) Contacting the customer;</P>
                        <P>(c) Changing any passwords, security codes, or other security devices that permit access to a covered account;</P>
                        <P>(d) Reopening a covered account with a new account number;</P>

                        <P>Financial institutions and creditors should update the Identity Theft Prevention Program (including the Red Flags determined to be relevant) periodically, to reflect changes in risks to customers or to the safety and soundness of the financial institution or creditor from identity theft, based on factors such as:</P>

                             Staff of the financial institution or creditor responsible for development, implementation, and administration of its Identity Theft Prevention Program should report to the board of directors, an appropriate committee of the board, or a designated senior management employee, at least annually, on compliance by the financial institution or creditor with § 162.30.

                             The report should address material matters related to the Identity Theft Prevention Program and evaluate issues such as: The effectiveness of the policies and procedures of the financial institution or creditor in addressing the risk of identity theft in connection with the opening of covered accounts and with respect to existing covered accounts; service provider arrangements; significant incidents involving identity theft and management's response; and recommendations for material changes to the Identity Theft Prevention Program.

                             Whenever a financial institution or creditor engages a service provider to perform an activity in connection with one or more covered accounts the financial institution or creditor should take steps to ensure that the activity of the service provider is conducted in accordance with reasonable policies and procedures designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate the risk of identity theft. For example, a financial institution or creditor could require the service provider by contract to have policies and procedures to detect relevant Red Flags that may arise in the performance of the service provider's activities, and either report the Red Flags to the financial institution or creditor, or to take appropriate steps to prevent or mitigate identity theft.

                        <P>In addition to incorporating Red Flags from the sources recommended in section II(b) of the Guidelines in Appendix B of this part, each financial institution or creditor may consider incorporating into its Identity Theft Prevention Program, whether singly or in combination, Red Flags from the following illustrative examples in connection with covered accounts:</P>

                        <P>1. A fraud or active duty alert is included with a consumer report.</P>
                        <P>2. A consumer reporting agency provides a notice of credit freeze in response to a request for a consumer report.</P>
                        <P>
                            3. A consumer reporting agency provides a notice of address discrepancy, as defined in Sec. 603(f) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681a(f)).

                        <P>10. Personal identifying information provided is inconsistent when compared against external information sources used by the financial institution or creditor. For example:</P>
                        <P>a. The address does not match any address in the consumer report; or</P>
                        <P>b. The Social Security Number (SSN) has not been issued, or is listed on the Social Security Administration's Death Master File.</P>
                        <P>11. Personal identifying information provided by the customer is not consistent with other personal identifying information provided by the customer. For example, there is a lack of correlation between the SSN range and date of birth.</P>
                        <P>12. Personal identifying information provided is associated with known fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party sources used by the financial institution or creditor. For example:</P>
                        <P>a. The address on an application is the same as the address provided on a fraudulent application; or</P>
                        <P>b. The phone number on an application is the same as the number provided on a fraudulent application.</P>
                        <P>13. Personal identifying information provided is of a type commonly associated with fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party sources used by the financial institution or creditor. For example:</P>
                        <P>a. The address on an application is fictitious, a mail drop, or a prison; or</P>
                        <P>b. The phone number is invalid, or is associated with a pager or answering service.</P>
                        <P>14. The SSN provided is the same as that submitted by other persons opening an account or other customers.</P>
                        <P>15. The address or telephone number provided is the same as or similar to the address or telephone number submitted by an unusually large number of other persons opening accounts or by other customers.</P>
                        <P>16. The person opening the covered account or the customer fails to provide all required personal identifying information on an application or in response to notification that the application is incomplete.</P>
                        <P>17. Personal identifying information provided is not consistent with personal identifying information that is on file with the financial institution or creditor.</P>
                        <P>18. For financial institutions or creditors that use challenge questions, the person opening the covered account or the customer cannot provide authenticating information beyond that which generally would be available from a wallet or consumer report.</P>
                        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Unusual Use of, or Suspicious Activity Related to, the Covered Account</HD>
                        <P>19. Shortly following the notice of a change of address for a covered account, the institution or creditor receives a request for a new, additional, or replacement means of accessing the account or for the addition of an authorized user on the account.</P>
                        <P>20. A new revolving credit account is used in a manner commonly associated with known patterns of fraud. For example:</P>
                        <P>a. The majority of available credit is used for cash advances or merchandise that is easily convertible to cash (e.g., electronics equipment or jewelry); or</P>
                        <P>b. The customer fails to make the first payment or makes an initial payment but no subsequent payments.</P>
                        <P>21. A covered account is used in a manner that is not consistent with established patterns of activity on the account. There is, for example:</P>
                        <P>a. Nonpayment when there is no history of late or missed payments;</P>
                        <P>b. A material increase in the use of available credit;</P>
                        <P>c. A material change in purchasing or spending patterns;</P>

                        <P>e. A material change in telephone call patterns in connection with a cellular phone account.</P>
                        <P>
                            22. A covered account that has been inactive for a reasonably lengthy period of time is used (taking into consideration the type of

                        </P>
                        <P>23. Mail sent to the customer is returned repeatedly as undeliverable although transactions continue to be conducted in connection with the customer's covered account.</P>
                        <P>24. The financial institution or creditor is notified that the customer is not receiving paper account statements.</P>

                    <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>
                    <P>Section 23 of the Commodity Exchange Act, entitled “Commodity Whistleblower Incentives and Protection,” requires the Commission to pay awards, subject to certain limitations and conditions, to whistleblowers who voluntarily provide the Commission with original information about violations of the Commodity Exchange Act. This part 165 describes the whistleblower program that the Commission intends to establish to implement the provisions of Section 23, and explains the procedures the whistleblower will need to follow in order to be eligible for an award. Whistleblowers should read these procedures carefully, because the failure to take certain required steps within the time frames described in this part may result in disqualification from receiving an award. Unless expressly provided for in this part, no person is authorized to make any offer or promise, or otherwise to bind the Commission with respect to the payment of any award or the amount thereof.</P>

                        (a) 
                        <E T="03">Action.</E>
                         The term “action” generally means a single captioned judicial or administrative proceeding. Notwithstanding the foregoing:
                    </P>
                    <P>(1) For purposes of making an award under § 165.7, the Commission will treat as a Commission action two or more administrative or judicial proceedings brought by the Commission if these proceedings arise out of the same nucleus of operative facts; or</P>
                    <P>
                        (2) For purposes of determining the payment on an award under § 165.14, the Commission will deem as part of the Commission action upon which the 
                        <PRTPAGE P="432"/>
                        award was based any subsequent Commission proceeding that, individually, results in a monetary sanction of $1,000,000 or less, and that arises out of the same nucleus of operative facts.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        (b) 
                        <E T="03">Aggregate amount.</E>
                         The phrase “aggregate amount” means the total amount of an award granted to one or more whistleblowers pursuant to § 165.8.

                        (c) 
                        <E T="03">Analysis.</E>
                         The term “analysis” means the whistleblower's examination and evaluation of information that may be generally available, but which reveals information that is not generally known or available to the public.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        (d) 
                        <E T="03">Collected by the Commission.</E>
                         The phrase “collected by the Commission” refers to any funds received, and confirmed by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, in satisfaction of part or all of a civil monetary penalty, disgorgement obligation, or fine owed to the Commission.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        (e) 
                        <E T="03">Covered judicial or administrative action.</E>
                         The phrase “covered judicial or administrative action” means any judicial or administrative action brought by the Commission under the Commodity Exchange Act whose successful resolution results in monetary sanctions exceeding $1,000,000.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        (f) 
                        <E T="03">Fund.</E>
                         The term “Fund” means the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Customer Protection Fund.
                    </P>

                        <E T="03">Independent knowledge.</E>
                         The phrase “independent knowledge” means factual information in the whistleblower's possession that is not generally known or available to the public. The whistleblower may gain independent knowledge from the whistleblower's experiences, communications and observations in the whistleblower's personal business or social interactions. The Commission will not consider the whistleblower's information to be derived from the whistleblower's independent knowledge if the whistleblower obtained the information:
                    </P>
                    <P>(1) From sources generally available to the public such as corporate filings and the media, including the Internet;</P>
                    <P>(2) Through a communication that was subject to the attorney-client privilege, unless the disclosure is otherwise permitted by the applicable federal or state attorney conduct rules;</P>
                    <P>(3) In connection with the legal representation of a client on whose behalf the whistleblower, or the whistleblower's employer or firm, have been providing services, and the whistleblower seek to use the information to make a whistleblower submission for the whistleblower's own benefit, unless disclosure is authorized by the applicable federal or state attorney conduct rules;</P>
                    <P>(4) Because the whistleblower was an officer, director, trustee, or partner of an entity and another person informed the whistleblower of allegations of misconduct, or the whistleblower learned the information in connection with the entity's processes for identifying, reporting, and addressing possible violations of law;</P>
                    <P>(5) Because the whistleblower was an employee whose principal duties involved compliance or internal audit responsibilities; or</P>
                    <P>(6) By a means or in a manner that is determined by a United States court to violate applicable Federal or state criminal law.</P>
                    <P>
                        (7) 
                        <E T="03">Exceptions.</E>
                         Paragraphs (g)(4) and (5) of this section shall not apply if:
                    </P>
                    <P>(i) The whistleblower has a reasonable basis to believe that disclosure of the information to the Commission is necessary to prevent the relevant entity from engaging in conduct that is likely to cause substantial injury to the financial interest or property of the entity or investors;</P>
                    <P>(ii) The whistleblower has a reasonable basis to believe that the relevant entity is engaging in conduct that will impede an investigation of the misconduct; or</P>
                    <P>(iii) At least 120 days have elapsed since the whistleblower provided the information to the relevant entity's audit committee, chief legal officer, chief compliance officer (or their equivalents), or the whistleblower's supervisor, or since the whistleblower received the information, if the whistleblower received it under circumstances indicating that the entity's audit committee, chief legal officer, chief compliance officer (or their equivalents), or the whistleblower's supervisor was already aware of the information.</P>
                    <P>
                        (h) 
                        <E T="03">Independent analysis.</E>
                         The phrase “independent analysis” means the 
                        <PRTPAGE P="433"/>
                        whistleblower's own analysis, whether done alone or in combination with others.

                    <P>
                        (i) 
                        <E T="03">Information that led to successful enforcement.</E>
                         The Commission will consider that the whistleblower provided original information that led to the successful enforcement of a judicial or administrative action, or related action, in the following circumstances:
                    </P>
                    <P>(1) The whistleblower gave the Commission original information that was sufficiently specific, credible, and timely to cause the Commission staff to commence an examination, open an investigation, reopen an investigation that the Commission had closed, or to inquire concerning different conduct as part of a current examination or investigation, and the Commission brought a successful judicial or administrative action based in whole or in part on conduct that was the subject of the whistleblower's original information; or</P>
                    <P>(2) The whistleblower gave the Commission original information about conduct that was already under examination or investigation by the Commission, the Congress, any other authority of the federal government, a state Attorney General or securities regulatory authority, any registered entity, registered futures association, or self-regulatory organization (as defined in section 3(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)), foreign futures authority, or the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (except in cases where the whistleblower was an original source of this information as defined in paragraph (l) of this section), and the whistleblower's submission significantly contributed to the success of the action.</P>
                    <P>(3) The whistleblower reported original information through an entity's internal whistleblower, legal, or compliance procedures for reporting allegations of possible violations of law before or at the same time the whistleblower reported them to the Commission; the entity later provided the whistleblower's information to the Commission, or provided results of an audit or investigation initiated in whole or in part in response to information the whistleblower reported to the entity; and the information the entity provided to the Commission satisfies either paragraph (i)(1) or (2) of this section. Under this paragraph (i)(3), the whistleblower must also submit the same information to the Commission in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 165.3 within 180 days of providing it to the entity.</P>
                    <P>
                        (j) 
                        <E T="03">Monetary sanctions.</E>
                         The phrase “monetary sanctions,” when used with respect to any judicial or administrative action, or related action, means—
                    </P>
                    <P>(1) Any monies, including penalties, disgorgement, restitution, and interest ordered to be paid; and</P>
                    <P>(2) Any monies deposited into a disgorgement fund or other fund pursuant to section 308(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (15 U.S.C. 7246(b)) as a result of such action or any settlement of such action.</P>
                    <P>
                        (k) 
                        <E T="03">Original information.</E>
                         The phrase “original information” means information that—
                    </P>
                    <P>(1) Is derived from the independent knowledge or independent analysis of a whistleblower;</P>
                    <P>(2) Is not already known to the Commission from any other source, unless the whistleblower is the original source of the information;</P>
                    <P>(3) Is not exclusively derived from an allegation made in a judicial or administrative hearing, in a governmental report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or from the news media, unless the whistleblower is a source of the information; and</P>
                    <P>(4) Is submitted to the Commission for the first time after July 21, 2010 (the date of enactment of the Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010).</P>
                    <P>(5) Original information shall not lose its status as original information solely because the whistleblower submitted such information prior to October 24, 2011, provided such information was submitted after July 21, 2010, the date of enactment of the Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010. In order to be eligible for an award, a whistleblower who submits original information to the Commission after July 21, 2010, but prior to October 24, 2011, must comply with the procedure set forth in § 165.3(d).</P>
                    <P>

                        <E T="03">Original source.</E>
                         The whistleblower must satisfy the whistleblower's status 
                        <PRTPAGE P="434"/>
                        as the original source of information to the Commission's satisfaction.

                        (1) 
                        <E T="03">Information obtained from another source.</E>
                         The Commission will consider the whistleblower to be an “original source” of the same information that the Commission obtains from another source if the information the whistleblower provide satisfies the definition of original information and the other source obtained the information from the whistleblower or the whistleblower's representative.
                    </P>
                    <P>(i) In order to be considered an original source of information that the Commission receives from Congress, any other federal, state or local authority, a foreign futures authority, any registered entity, registered futures association, or any self-regulatory organization (as defined in section 3(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)), the whistleblower must have voluntarily given such authorities the information within the meaning of this part. In determining whether the whistleblower is the original source of information, the Commission may seek assistance and confirmation from one of the other entities or authorities described in this paragraph (l)(1)(i).</P>
                    <P>(ii) In the event that the whistleblower claims to be the original source of information that an authority or another entity, other than as set forth in paragraph (l)(1)(i) of this section, provided to the Commission, the Commission may seek assistance and confirmation from such authority or other entity.</P>
                    <P>
                        (2) 
                        <E T="03">Information first provided to another authority or person.</E>
                         If the whistleblower provides information to Congress, any other federal, state, or local authority, a foreign futures authority, a registered entity, a registered futures association, a self-regulatory organization (as defined in section 3(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)), or to any of the persons described in paragraphs (g)(4) and (5) of this section, and the whistleblower, within 180 days, makes a submission to the Commission pursuant to § 165.3, as the whistleblower must do in order for the whistleblower to be eligible to be considered for an award, then, for purposes of evaluating the whistleblower's claim to an award under § 165.7, the Commission will consider that the whistleblower provided original information as of the date of the whistleblower's original disclosure, report, or submission to one of these other authorities or persons. The whistleblower must establish the whistleblower's status as the original source of such information, as well as the effective date of any prior disclosure, report, or submission, to the Commission's satisfaction. The Commission may seek assistance and confirmation from the other authority or person in making this determination.
                    </P>

                        <E T="03">Information already known by the Commission.</E>
                         If the Commission already knows some information about a matter from other sources at the time the whistleblower makes the whistleblower's submission, and the whistleblower is not an original source of that information, as described above, the Commission will consider the whistleblower an “original source” of any information the whistleblower separately provides that is original information that materially adds to the information that the Commission already possesses.

                        <E T="03">Related action.</E>
                         The phrase “related action,” when used with respect to any judicial or administrative action brought by the Commission under the Commodity Exchange Act, means any judicial or administrative action brought by an entity listed in § 165.11(a) that is based upon the original information voluntarily submitted by a whistleblower to the Commission pursuant to § 165.3 that led to the successful resolution of the Commission action.

                        <E T="03">Successful resolution.</E>
                         The phrase “successful resolution,” when used with respect to any judicial or administrative action brought by the Commission under the Commodity Exchange Act, includes any settlement of such action or final judgment in favor of the Commission. It shall also have the same meaning as “successful enforcement.”

                         (1) The phrase “voluntary submission” or “voluntarily submitted” within the context of submission of original information to the 
                        <PRTPAGE P="435"/>
                        Commission under this part, shall mean the provision of information made prior to any request from the Commission, Congress, any other federal or state authority, the Department of Justice, a registered entity, a registered futures association, or a self-regulatory organization (as defined in section 3(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)) to the whistleblower or anyone representing the whistleblower (such as an attorney) about a matter to which the information in the whistleblower's submission is relevant. If the Commission or any of these other authorities makes a request, inquiry, or demand to the whistleblower or the whistleblower's representative first, the whistleblower's submission will not be considered voluntary, and the whistleblower will not be eligible for an award, even if the whistleblower's response is not compelled by subpoena or other applicable law. For purposes of this paragraph (o), the whistleblower will be considered to have received a request, inquiry or demand if documents or information from the whistleblower is within the scope of a request, inquiry, or demand that the whistleblower's employer receives, unless, after receiving the documents or information from the whistleblower, the whistleblower's employer fails to provide the whistleblower's documents or information to the requesting authority in a timely manner.
                    </P>
                    <P>(2) In addition, the whistleblower's submission will not be considered voluntary if the whistleblower is under a pre-existing legal or contractual duty to report the violations that are the subject of the whistleblower's original information to the Commission, Congress, any other federal or state authority, the Department of Justice, a registered entity, a registered futures association, or a self-regulatory organization (as defined in section 3(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)), or a duty that arises out of a judicial or administrative order.</P>

                    <P>(2) The Form WB-APP, including any attachments, must be received by the Commission within 90 calendar days of the date of the Notice of Covered Action or 90 calendar days following the date of a final judgment in a Related Action (or if the final judgment in a Related Action was issued prior to the action meeting the definition of Related Action, within 90 calendar days following the date the action satisfied the definition of Related Action, except in the circumstances described in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section). One Form WB-APP may be filed in response to both a Notice of Covered Action and final judgment in a Related Action if the relevant time periods are applicable.</P>
                    <P>(3) If a covered judicial or administrative action and Related Action have different final judgment dates or if there is no covered judicial or administrative action connected to a Related Action, a claimant, who wishes to file a claim for an award in both a covered judicial or administrative action and a Related Action, or in a Related Action that does not have a connected covered judicial or administrative action, must follow one of the following procedures depending on that claimant's particular situation.</P>
                    <P>(i) If a final judgment imposing monetary sanctions in a Related Action has not been entered at the time the claimant submits a claim for an award in connection with a covered judicial or administrative action, the claimant must submit the claim for the Related Action on Form WB-APP within ninety (90) calendar days following the date of issuance of a final judgment in the Related Action.</P>
                    <P>(ii) If a final judgment in a Related Action has been entered and a Notice of Covered Action for a related covered judicial or administrative action has not been published, a claimant for an award in both the covered judicial or administrative action and Related Action may submit the claims for both the Related Action and the covered judicial or administrative action within ninety (90) days of the date of the Notice of Covered Action. The claims may be submitted on the same Form WB-APP.</P>
                    <P>
                        (iii) If there is a final judgment in a Related Action that relates to a judicial or administrative action brought by the Commission under the Commodity Exchange Act that is not a covered judicial or administrative action, and therefore there is no Notice of Covered Action, a claimant for an award in 
                        <PRTPAGE P="439"/>
                        connection with the Related Action must submit the claim in connection with the Related Action on Form WB-APP within ninety (90) calendar days following either:

                    <P>(A) The date of issuance of a final judgment in the Related Action, if that date is after the date of issuance of the final judgment in the related Commission judicial or administrative action; or</P>

                        (B) The date of issuance of the final judgment in the related Commission judicial or administrative action, 
                        <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                         the date the Related Action becomes a Related Action, if the date of issuance of the final judgment in the Related Action precedes the final judgment in the related Commission judicial or administrative action.
                    </P>
                    <P>(c) If the whistleblower provided the whistleblower's original information to the Commission anonymously pursuant to §§ 165.3 and 165.4 and:</P>
                    <P>(1) The whistleblower is making the whistleblower's claim for a whistleblower award on a disclosed basis, the whistleblower must disclose the whistleblower's identity on the Form WB-APP. The whistleblower's identity must be verified in a form and manner that is acceptable to the Commission prior to the payment of any award; or</P>
                    <P>(2) The whistleblower is making the whistleblower's claim for a whistleblower award on an anonymous basis, the whistleblower must be represented by counsel. The whistleblower must provide the whistleblower's counsel with a completed Form WB-APP that is signed by the whistleblower by no later than the date upon which the whistleblower's counsel submits to the Commission a copy of the Form WB-APP that does not disclose the whistleblower's identity and is signed solely by the whistleblower's counsel. In addition, the whistleblower's counsel must retain the signed original of the whistleblower's Form WB-APP in counsel's records. Upon request of the Commission staff, whistleblower's counsel must produce to the Commission the whistleblower's signed original WB-APP and the whistleblower's identity must be verified in a form and manner that is acceptable to the Commission prior to the payment of any award.</P>
                    <P>(d) A claimant may withdraw a Form WB-APP by submitting a written request to the Whistleblower Office at any time during the review process.</P>
                    <P>(e)(1) The Whistleblower Office may issue a Proposed Final Disposition for award applications that do not relate to a Notice of Covered Action, a final judgment in a Related Action, or a previously filed Form TCR without presentation of the award claim to the staff designated by the Director of the Division of Enforcement under § 165.15(a)(2) (“Claims Review Staff”). In such instances, the Whistleblower Office will inform the award claimant in writing that the claim does not relate to a Notice of Covered Action, a final judgment in a Related Action, or a previously filed Form TCR and will be rejected unless the claimant provides additional information. The claimant will have 30 days from the date of the written notice to respond and to correct the identified deficiencies. If the claimant does not respond in 30 days or if the response does not include information showing that the WB-APP relates to a Notice of Covered Action, a final judgment in a Related Action, or a previously filed Form TCR the Whistleblower Office will issue a Proposed Final Disposition. The claimant's failure to submit a timely response to the written notice from the Whistleblower Office will constitute a failure to exhaust administrative remedies, and the claimant will be prohibited from pursuing an appeal under § 165.13.</P>
                    <P>
                        (2) The Whistleblower Office will notify the Claims Review Staff of any Proposed Final Disposition under this paragraph (e). Within thirty (30) calendar days thereafter, any member of the Claims Review Staff may request that the Proposed Final Disposition be reviewed by the Claims Review Staff. If no member of the Claims Review Staff requests such a review within the 30-day period, then the Proposed Final Disposition will become the Final Order of the Commission. In the event that a member of the Claims Review Staff requests a review, the Claims Review Staff will review the record that the Whistleblower Office relied upon in making its determination and either remand to the Whistleblower Office for further action or issue a Final Order of 
                        <PRTPAGE P="440"/>
                        the Commission, which could consist of the Proposed Final Disposition.
                    </P>
                    <P>(f)(1) In connection with each individual covered judicial or administrative action or final judgment in a Related Action, for which an award application is submitted, once the time for filing any appeals of the covered judicial or administrative action or the final judgment in the Related Action has expired (or, where an appeal is filed of the covered judicial or administrative action, or the final judgment in a Related Action, as applicable, and concluded), the Claims Review Staff designated under § 165.15(a)(2) will evaluate all timely whistleblower award claims submitted on Form WB-APP in response to a Notice of Covered Action, referenced in paragraph (a) of this section, or final judgment in a Related Action in accordance with the criteria set forth in this part.</P>
                    <P>(2) The Whistleblower Office may require that the claimant provide additional information relating to the claimant's eligibility for an award or satisfaction of any of the conditions for an award, as set forth in § 165.5(b)(2). The Whistleblower Office may also request additional information from the claimant in connection with the claim for an award in a Related Action to demonstrate that the claimant directly (or through the Commission) voluntarily provided the governmental agency, regulatory authority or self-regulatory organization the original information that led to the Commission's successful covered action, and that the information provided by the claimant led to the successful enforcement of the Related Action. The Whistleblower Office may also, in its discretion, seek assistance and confirmation from the other agency in making this determination.</P>
                    <P>(g)(1) Following Claims Review Staff evaluation, the Claims Review Staff will issue a Preliminary Determination setting forth a preliminary assessment as to whether the claim should be granted or denied and, if granted, setting forth the proposed award percentage amount. The Whistleblower Office will send a copy of the Preliminary Determination to the claimant.</P>
                    <P>(2) The claimant may contest the Preliminary Determination made by the Claims Review Staff by submitting a written response to the Whistleblower Office setting forth the grounds for the claimant's objection to either the denial of an award or the proposed amount of an award. The response must be in the form and manner that the Whistleblower Office shall require. The claimant may also include documentation or other evidentiary support for the grounds advanced in the claimant's response.

                    <P>(i) Before determining whether to contest a Preliminary Determination, the claimant may, within thirty (30) days of the date of the Preliminary Determination, request that the Whistleblower Office make available for the claimant's review the materials from among those set forth in § 165.10 that formed the basis of the Claims Review Staff's Preliminary Determination.</P>
                    <P>(ii) If the claimant decides to contest the Preliminary Determination, the claimant must submit the claimant's written response and supporting materials setting forth the grounds for the claimant's objection to either the denial of an award or the proposed amount of an award within sixty (60) calendar days of the date of the Preliminary Determination, or if a request to review materials used to make a Preliminary Determination is made pursuant to paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section, then within sixty (60) calendar days of the Whistleblower Office making those materials available for the claimant's review. The claimant also may request a meeting with the Whistleblower Office within those same sixty (60) calendar days. However, such meetings are not required and the Whistleblower Office may in its sole discretion decline the request.</P>

                        deemed a Proposed Final Determination for purposes of paragraph (j) of this section). The claimant's failure to submit a timely response contesting a Preliminary Determination will constitute a failure to exhaust administrative remedies, and the claimant will be prohibited from pursuing an appeal under § 165.13.

                    <P>(j) The Whistleblower Office will notify the Commission of each Proposed Final Determination. Within thirty (30) calendar days thereafter, any Commissioner may request that the Proposed Final Determination be reviewed by the Commission. If no Commissioner requests such a review within the 30-day period, then the Proposed Final Determination will become the Final Order of the Commission. In the event a Commissioner requests a review, the Commission will review the record that the staff relied upon in making its determinations, including the claimant's submissions to the Whistleblower Office, and issue its Final Order.</P>
                    <P>(k) A Preliminary Determination, Proposed Final Disposition, or a Proposed Final Determination may be issued only after a review for legal sufficiency by the Office of the General Counsel.</P>

                    <P>
                        This notice is given under the Privacy Act of 1974. The Privacy Act requires that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) inform individuals of the following when asking for information. The solicitation of this information is authorized under the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. 1 
                        <E T="03">et seq.</E>
                         The information provided will enable the CFTC to determine the whistleblower award claimant's eligibility for payment of an award pursuant to Section 23 of the Commodity Exchange Act and Part 165 of the CFTC's regulations. This information will be used to investigate and prosecute violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and the CFTC's regulations. This information may be disclosed to federal, state, local or foreign agencies or other authorities responsible for investigating, prosecuting, enforcing or implementing laws, rules or regulations implicated by the information consistent with the confidentiality requirements set forth in Section 23 of the Commodity Exchange Act and Part 165 of the CFTC's regulations. The information will be maintained and additional disclosures may be made in accordance with System of Records Notices CFTC-49, “Whistleblower Records” (exempted), CFTC-10, “Investigatory Records” (exempted), and CFTC-16, “Enforcement Case Files.” The CFTC requests the last four digits of the claimant's Social Security Number for use as an individual identifier to administer and manage the whistleblower award program. Executive Order 9397 (November 22, 1943) allows federal agencies to use the Social Security Number as an individual identifier. Furnishing the information is voluntary. However, if an individual is providing information for the whistleblower award program, not providing required information may result in the individual not being eligible for award consideration.

                    <P>
                        The process for making a claim for a whistleblower award for a CFTC action begins with the publication of a “Notice of Covered Action” on the CFTC's Web site. This Notice is published whenever a judicial or administrative action brought by the CFTC results 
                        <PRTPAGE P="469"/>
                        in the imposition of monetary sanctions exceeding $1,000,000. The Notice is published on the CFTC's Web site subsequent to the entry of a final judgment or order in the action that by itself, or collectively with other judgments or orders previously entered in the action, exceeds the $1,000,000 threshold required for a whistleblower to be potentially eligible for an award. The CFTC will not contact whistleblower claimants directly as to Notices of Covered Actions; prospective claimants should monitor the CFTC Web site for such Notices.

                        Section 23(c)(1)(B) of the Commodity Exchange Act and § 165.9(a) of the CFTC's regulations require the CFTC to consider the following factors in determining the amount of an award: (1) The significance of the information provided by a whistleblower to the success of the CFTC action or related action; (2) the degree of assistance provided by the whistleblower and any legal representative of the whistleblower in the CFTC action or related action; (3) the programmatic interest of the CFTC in deterring violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (including regulations under the Act) by making awards to whistleblowers who provide information that leads to the successful enforcement of such laws; (4) whether the award otherwise enhances the CFTC's ability to enforce the Commodity Exchange Act, protect customers, and encourage the submission of high quality information from whistleblowers; and (5) potential adverse incentives from oversize awards. Address these factors in your response as well.

                        <P>The CFTC recognizes that the opportunity to settle disputes by arbitration may in some cases provide many benefits to customers, including the ability to obtain an expeditious and final resolution of disputes without incurring substantial costs.

You are not, however, waiving your right to elect instead to petition the CFTC to institute reparations proceedings under Section 14 of the Commodity Exchange Act with respect to any dispute that may be arbitrated pursuant to this agreement. In the event a dispute arises, you will be notified if [name] intends to submit the dispute to arbitration.

The designated contract market may permit such a counterclaim where the counterclaim arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject of the customer's claim or grievance and does not require for adjudication the presence of essential witnesses, parties, or third persons over whom the designated contract market does not have jurisdiction. Other counterclaims arising out of a transaction subject to the Act and rules promulgated thereunder for which the customer utilizes the services of the registrant may be permissible where the customer and the registrant have agreed in advance to require that all such submissions be included in the proceeding, and if the aggregate monetary value of the counterclaims is capable of calculation.

                        <P>A futures association must demonstrate that it will be able to carry out the purposes of section 17 of the Act. Since a basic purpose of a futures association is to regulate the practices of its members, an association should demonstrate that it will require its members to adhere to regulatory requirements governing their business practices at least as stringent as those imposed by the Commission. For example, the association should be prepared to establish and maintain in accordance with § 1.52 of this chapter, a financial compliance program for those members of the association who are futures commission merchants.</P>

                             Upon review, the Commission may affirm, modify, set aside, or remand for further proceedings, in whole or in part, the decision of the National Futures Association. The Commission's decision will be contained in its opinion and order which will be based upon the record before it, including the record of the registered futures association proceeding, briefs submitted to the Commission by the parties and any oral argument made in accordance with § 171.32. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the opinion and order will constitute the final decision of the Commission, effective upon service on the parties. In the event the Commission is equally divided as to its decision, the decision of the National Futures Association shall be affirmed without a Commission opinion.

                             If the Commission finds that the result reached in the decision of the National Futures Association is substantially correct and that none of the arguments on appeal made by the appellant raise important questions of law or policy, the Commission may, by appropriate order, summarily affirm the decision without opinion. The decision of the National Futures Association shall constitute the Commission's final decision, effective upon service. Unless the Commission expressly indicates otherwise in its order, an order of summary affirmance does not reflect a Commission determination to adopt the rationale of the National Futures Association, and neither the order of summary affirmance nor the underlying order shall serve as Commission precedent in other proceedings.

                             The Commission has adopted the regulations in this part pursuant to its authority under sections 8a(5) and 20 of the Act. Section 8a(5) provides general rulemaking authority to effectuate the provisions and accomplish the purposes of the Act. Section 20 provides that the Commission may, notwithstanding title 11 of the United States Code, adopt certain rules or regulations governing a proceeding involving a commodity broker that is a debtor under subchapter IV of chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. Specifically, the Commission is authorized to adopt rules or regulations specifying:
                        </P>
                        <P>(1) That certain cash, securities, or other property, or commodity contracts, are to be included in or excluded from customer property or member property;</P>
                        <P>(2) That certain cash, securities, or other property, or commodity contracts, are to be specifically identifiable to a particular customer in a particular capacity;</P>
                        <P>(3) The method by which the business of the commodity broker is to be conducted or liquidated after the date of the filing of the petition under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, including the payment and allocation of margin with respect to commodity contracts not specifically identifiable to a particular customer pending their orderly liquidation;</P>
                        <P>(4) Any persons to which customer property and commodity contracts may be transferred under section 766 of the Bankruptcy Code; and</P>
                        <P>(5) How a customer's net equity is to be determined.</P>

                             This part is organized into three subparts. This subpart contains general provisions applicable in all cases. Subpart B of this part contains provisions that apply when the debtor is a futures commission merchant (as that term is defined in the Act or Commission regulations). This includes acting as a foreign futures commission merchant, as defined in section 761(12) of the Bankruptcy Code, 
                            <PRTPAGE P="493"/>
                            but excludes a person that is “notice-registered” as a futures commission merchant pursuant to section 4f(a)(2) of the Act. Subpart C contains provisions that apply when the debtor is registered as a derivatives clearing organization under the Act.

                             The regulations in this part reflect several core concepts. The descriptions of core concepts in paragraphs (c)(1) through (6) of this section are subject to the further specific requirements set forth in this part, and the specific requirements in this part should be interpreted and applied consistently with these core concepts.

                             Subchapter IV of chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code applies to a debtor that is a commodity broker, against which a customer holds a “net equity” claim relating to a commodity contract. This part is limited to a commodity broker that is:
                        </P>

                             The Act and Commission regulations in parts 1, 22, and 30 of this chapter provide differing treatment and protections for different types of cleared commodity contracts. This part establishes three account classes that correspond to the different types of accounts that futures commission merchants and clearing organizations are required to maintain under the regulations in the preceding sentence, specifically, the futures account class (including options on futures), the foreign futures account class (including options on foreign futures), and the cleared swaps account class (including cleared options other than options on futures or foreign futures). This part also establishes a fourth account class, the delivery account class (which may be further subdivided as provided in this part), for property held in an account designated within the books and records of the debtor as a delivery account, for effecting delivery under commodity contracts whose terms require settlement via delivery when the commodity contract is held to expiration or, in the case of a cleared option, is exercised.

                            <E T="03">Public customers and non-public customers.</E>
                             This part prescribes separate treatment of “public customers” and “non-public customers” (as these terms are defined in § 190.01) within each account class in the event of a proceeding under this part in which the debtor is a futures commission merchant. Public customers of a debtor futures commission merchant are entitled to a priority in the distribution of cash, securities, or other customer property over non-public customers, and both have priority over all other claimants (except for claims relating to the administration of customer property) pursuant to section 766(h) of the Bankruptcy Code.
                        </P>
                        <P>(A) The cash, securities, or other property held on behalf of the public customers of a futures commission merchant in the futures, foreign futures, or cleared swaps account classes are subject to special segregation requirements imposed under parts 1, 22, and 30 of this chapter for each account class. Although such segregation requirements generally are not applicable to cash, securities, or other property received from or reflected in the futures, foreign futures, or cleared swaps accounts of non-public customers of a futures commission merchant, such transactions and property are customer property within the scope of this part.</P>
                        <P>(B) While parts 1, 22, and 30 of this chapter do not impose special segregation requirements with respect to treatment of cash, securities, or other property of public customers carried in a delivery account, such property does constitute customer property. Thus, the distinction between public and non-public customers is, given the priority for public customers in section 766(h) of the Bankruptcy Code, relevant for the purpose of making distributions to delivery account class customers pursuant to this part.</P>

                            (C) Where a provision in this part affords the trustee discretion, that discretion should be exercised in a manner that the trustee determines will best achieve the overarching goal of protecting public customers as a class by

                            enhancing recoveries for, and mitigating disruptions to, public customers as a class. In seeking to achieve that overarching goal, the trustee has discretion to balance those two sub-goals when they are in tension. Where the trustee is directed to exercise “reasonable efforts” to meet a standard, those efforts should only be less than “best efforts” to the extent that the trustee determines that such an approach would support the foregoing goals.
                        </P>

                            <E T="03">Clearing organization bankruptcies: Member property and customer property other than member property.</E>
                             For a clearing organization, “customer property” is divided into “member property” and “customer property other than member property.” The term member property is used to identify the cash, securities, or property available to pay the net equity claims of clearing members based on their house account at the clearing organization. Thus, in the event of a proceeding under this part in which the debtor is a clearing organization, the classification of customers as public customers or non-public customers also is relevant, in that each member of the clearing organization will have separate claims against the clearing organization (by account class) with respect to:
                        </P>
                        <P>(A) Commodity contract transactions cleared for its own account or on behalf of any of its non-public customers (which are cleared in a “house account” at the clearing organization); and</P>
                        <P>(B) Commodity contract transactions cleared on behalf of any public customers of the clearing member (which are cleared in accounts at the clearing organization that is separate and distinct from house accounts).</P>

                             Section 190.18 is designed to support the interests of public customers of members of a debtor that is a clearing organization.
                        </P>
                        <P>(A) Certain customer property is preferentially assigned to “customer property other than member property” instead of “member property” to the extent that there is a shortfall in funded balances for members' public customer claims. Moreover, to the extent that there are excess funded balances for members' claims in any customer class/account class combination, that excess is also preferentially assigned to “customer property other than member property” to the extent of any shortfall in funded balances for members' public customer claims.</P>
                        <P>(B) Where property is assigned to a particular customer class with more than one account class, it is assigned to the account class for which the funded balance percentage is the lowest until there are two account classes with equal funded balance percentages, then to both such account classes, keeping the funded balance percentage the same, and so forth following the analogous approach if the debtor has more than two account classes within the relevant customer class.</P>

                             In a proceeding in which the debtor is a futures commission merchant, this part sets out a policy preference for transferring to another futures commission merchant, or “porting,” open commodity contract positions of the debtor's public customers along with all or a portion of such customers' account equity. Porting mitigates risks to both the customers of the debtor futures commission merchant and to the markets. To facilitate porting, this part addresses the manner in which the debtor's business is to be conducted on and after the filing date, with specific provisions addressing the collection and payment of margin for open commodity contract positions prior to porting.

                             (i) The commodity broker provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, subchapter IV of chapter 7, in particular section 766(h), have long revolved around the principle of pro rata distribution. If there is a shortfall in the cash, securities or other property in a particular account class needed to satisfy the net equity claims of public customers in that account class, the customer property in that account class will be distributed pro rata to those public customers (subject to appendix B of this part). Any customer property not attributable to a specific account class, or that exceeds the amount needed to pay 
                            <PRTPAGE P="495"/>
                            allowed customer net equity claims in a particular account class, will be distributed to public customers in other account classes so long as there is a shortfall in those other classes. Non-public customers will not receive any distribution of customer property so long as there is any shortfall, in any account class, of customer property needed to satisfy public customer net equity claims.
                        </P>
                        <P>(ii) The pro rata distribution principle means that, if there is a shortfall of customer property in an account class, all customers within that account class will suffer the same proportional loss relative to their allowed net equity claims. The principle in this paragraph (c)(5)(ii) applies to all customers, including those who post as collateral specifically identifiable property or letters of credit. The pro rata distribution principle is subject to the special distribution provisions set forth in framework 1 in appendix B of this part for cross-margin accounts and framework 2 in appendix B of this part for funds held outside of the U.S. or held in non-U.S. currency.</P>

                             (i) Commodity contracts may have terms that require a customer owning the contract:
                        </P>
                        <P>(A) To make or take delivery of the underlying commodity if the customer holds the contract to a delivery position; or</P>
                        <P>(B) In the case of an option on a commodity:</P>
                        <P>
                            (

                            ) To make delivery upon exercise (as the buyer of a put option or seller of a call option); or
                        </P>
                        <P>

                            ) To take delivery upon exercise (as seller of a put option or buyer of a call option).
                        </P>
                        <P>(ii) Depending upon the circumstances and relevant market, delivery may be effected via a delivery account, a futures account, a foreign futures account or a cleared swaps account, or, when the commodity subject to delivery is a security, in a securities account (in which case property associated with the delivery held in a securities account is not part of any customer account class for purposes of this part).</P>
                        <P>
                            (iii) Although commodity contracts with delivery obligations are typically offset before reaching the delivery stage (

                             prior to triggering bilateral delivery obligations), when delivery obligations do arise, a delivery default could have a disruptive effect on the cash market for the commodity and adversely impact the parties to the transaction. This part therefore sets out special provisions to address open commodity contracts that are settled by delivery, when those positions are nearing or have entered into a delivery position at the time of or after the filing date. The delivery provisions in this part are intended to allow deliveries to be completed in accordance with the rules and established practices for the relevant commodity contract market or clearing organization, as applicable and to the extent permitted under this part.
                        </P>
                        <P>(iv) In a proceeding in which the debtor is a futures commission merchant, the delivery provisions in this part reflect policy preferences to:</P>
                        <P>(A) Liquidate commodity contracts that settle via delivery before they move into a delivery position; and</P>
                        <P>(B) When such contracts are in a delivery position, to allow delivery to occur, where practicable, outside administration of the debtor's estate.</P>
                        <P>(v) The delivery provisions in this part apply to any commodity that is subject to delivery under a commodity contract, as the term commodity is defined in section of 1a(9) of the Act, whether the commodity itself is tangible or intangible, including agricultural commodities as defined in § 1.3 of this chapter, other non-financial commodities (such as metals or energy commodities) covered by the definition of exempt commodity in section 1a(20) of the Act, and commodities that are financial in nature (such as foreign currencies) covered by the definition of excluded commodity in section 1a(19) of the Act. The delivery provisions also apply to virtual currencies that are subject to delivery under a commodity contract.</P>

                             In the event that a clearing organization, foreign clearing organization, futures commission merchant, foreign futures intermediary, or other person carrying a commodity customer account for the debtor in the nature of an omnibus account has liquidated only a portion of open commodity contracts in such account, the trustee will exercise reasonable business judgment in assigning the liquidating transactions to the underlying commodity customer accounts carried by the debtor. Specifically, the trustee should endeavor to assign the contracts as follows: First, to liquidate open commodity contracts in a risk-reducing manner in any accounts that are in deficit; second, to liquidate open commodity contracts in a risk-reducing manner in any accounts that are undermargined; third, to liquidate open commodity contracts in a risk-reducing manner in any other accounts, and finally to liquidate any remaining open commodity contracts in any accounts. If more than one commodity contract account reflects open commodity contracts in a particular account class for which liquidating transactions have been executed, the trustee shall to the extent practicable allocate the liquidating transactions to such commodity contract accounts pro rata based on the number of open commodity contracts of such commodity contract accounts. For purposes of this section, the term “a risk-reducing manner” is measured by margin requirements set using the margin methodology and parameters followed by the derivatives clearing organization at which such contracts are cleared.

The amount of the request may equal the full face amount of the letter of the credit or any portion thereof, to the extent required or may be required in the trustee's discretion to ensure pro rata treatment among customer claims within each account class, consistent with §§ 190.08 and 190.09.

If a futures commission merchant or foreign futures intermediary fails to use commercially reasonable efforts to liquidate open commodity contracts to achieve competitive pricing in accordance with this paragraph (e)(3), the trustee may seek damages reflecting the difference between the price (or prices) at which the relevant commodity contracts would have been liquidated using commercially reasonable efforts to achieve competitive pricing and the price (or prices) at which the commodity contracts were liquidated, which shall be the sole remedy available to the trustee.

                             The trustee for a commodity broker shall use its best efforts to effect a transfer to one or more other commodity brokers of all eligible commodity contract accounts, open commodity contracts and property held by the debtor for or on behalf of its customers, based on customer claims or record, no later than the seventh calendar day after the order for relief.

                             If all eligible commodity contract accounts held by a debtor cannot be transferred under this section, a partial transfer may nonetheless be made. The Commission will not disapprove such a transfer for the sole reason that it was a partial transfer. Commodity contract accounts may be transferred to one or more transferees, and, subject to paragraph (d)(4) of this section, may be transferred to different transferees by account class.

                             If all of a customer's open commodity contracts and property cannot be transferred under this section, a partial transfer of contracts and property may be made so long as such transfer would not result in an increase in the amount of any customer's net equity claim. One, but not the only, means to effectuate a partial transfer is by liquidating a portion of the open commodity contracts held by a customer such that sufficient value is realized, or margin requirements are reduced to an extent sufficient, to permit the transfer of some or all of the remaining open commodity contracts and property. If any open commodity contract to be transferred in a partial transfer is part of a spread or straddle, to the extent practicable under the circumstances, each side of such spread or straddle must be transferred or none of the open commodity contracts comprising the spread or straddle may be transferred.

                             A letter of credit received, acquired, or held to margin, guarantee, secure, purchase, or sell a commodity contract may be transferred with an eligible commodity contract account if it is held by a derivatives clearing organization on a pass-through or other basis or is transferable by its terms, so long as the transfer will not result in a recovery which exceeds the amount to which the customer would be entitled under §§ 190.08 and 190.09. If the letter of credit cannot be transferred as provided for in the foregoing sentence, and the customer does not deliver substitute customer property to the trustee in accordance with § 190.04(d)(3), the trustee may draw upon a portion or all of the letter of credit, the proceeds of which shall be treated as customer property in the applicable account class.

                             The trustee shall use reasonable efforts to prevent physical delivery property held for the purpose of making delivery on a commodity contract from being transferred separate and apart from the related commodity contract, or to a different transferee.

Such funds when received, other than deposits of initial margin described in § 39.14(a)(1)(iii) of this chapter, shall be considered member property and, separately, customer property other than member property, in proportion to the ratio of total gains in member accounts with net gains, and total gains in clearing members' customer accounts with net gains, respectively. Deposits of initial margin described in § 39.14(a)(1)(iii) of this chapter shall be considered member property and, separately, customer property other than member property, to the extent deposited on behalf of, respectively, clearing members' house accounts and customer accounts.
                        </P>
                        <P>(b) To the extent there is a shortfall in funds received pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section:</P>
                        <P>(1) Such funds shall be supplemented with the property described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section, as applicable, to the extent necessary to meet the shortfall, in accordance with the derivatives clearing organization's default rules and procedures adopted pursuant to § 39.16 and, as applicable, § 39.35 of this chapter, and (with respect to paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section) any recovery and wind-down plans maintained pursuant to § 39.39 of this chapter and submitted pursuant to § 39.19 of this chapter. Such funds shall be included as member property and customer property other than member property in the proportion described in paragraph (a) of this section, and shall be distributed promptly to members' house accounts and members' customer accounts which accounts are entitled to payment of such funds as part of that daily settlement.</P>
                        <P>(i) Initial margin held for the account of a member, including initial margin segregated for the customers of such member, that has defaulted on payments required pursuant to a daily settlement, but only to the extent that such margin is permitted to be used pursuant to parts 1, 22, and 30 of this chapter.</P>
                        <P>(ii) Assets of the debtor, to the extent dedicated to such use as part of the debtor's default rules and procedures, and any recovery and wind-down plans, described in this paragraph (b)(1).</P>

                        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Framework 1—Special Distribution of Customer Funds When the Cross-Margining Account Is a Futures Account</HD>
                        <P>(a) This framework 1 applies when a debtor futures commission merchant has participated in a cross-margining (“XM”) program for futures and securities under which the cross-margined positions of its futures customers (as defined in § 1.3 of this chapter) and the property received to margin, secure or guarantee such positions are held in one or more accounts pursuant to a Commission order that requires such positions and property to be segregated, pursuant to section 4d(a) of the Act, from the positions and property of:</P>
                        <P>(1) The futures commission merchant;</P>
                        <P>(2) If applicable, any affiliate carrying the securities positions as a participant in the XM program (“Affiliate”); and</P>
                        <P>(3) Other futures customers of the futures commission merchant (such segregated accounts, the “XM accounts”).</P>
                        <P>(b) The futures commission merchant may, and any Affiliate that holds the securities positions in an XM account that it directly carries will, be registered as a broker-dealer under the Exchange Act. The Commission order approving the XM program may limit participating customers to market professionals and will require a participating customer to sign an agreement, in a form approved by the Commission, that refers to this distributional rule.</P>
                        <P>
                            (c) A futures commission merchant is deemed to receive securities held in an XM account, including securities and other property held by an Affiliate in an XM account, as “futures customer funds” (as defined in § 1.3 of this chapter) that margin, guarantee or secure commodity contracts in the XM account (or paired XM accounts at the futures commission merchant and an Affiliate). 
                            <PRTPAGE P="543"/>
                            Under the agreement signed by the customer, in the event that the futures commission merchant (or Affiliate) is the subject of a SIPA proceeding, the customer agrees that securities in an XM account are excluded from the securities estate for purposes of SIPA, and that its claim for return of the securities will not be treated as a customer claim under SIPA. These restrictions apply to the customer only, and should not be read to limit any action that the trustee may take to seek recovery of property in an XM account carried by an Affiliate as part of the customer estate of the futures commission merchant.
                        </P>
                        <P>(d) XM accounts, and other futures accounts that are subject to segregation under section 4d(a) of the Act (pursuant to the Commission's regulations in part 1 of this chapter) (“non-XM accounts”), are treated as two subclasses of futures account with two separate pools of segregated futures customer property, an XM pool and a non-XM pool, each of which constitutes a segregated pool under section 4d(a) of the Act. If the futures commission merchant has participated in multiple XM programs, the XM accounts in the different programs are combined and treated as part of the same XM subclass of futures accounts. A futures customer could hold both non-XM and XM accounts.</P>
                        <P>(e) Customer claims under this part arising out of the XM subclass of accounts are subordinated to customer claims arising out of the non-XM subclass of accounts in certain circumstances in which the futures commission merchant does not meet its segregation requirements. The segregation requirement is the amount of futures customer funds that the futures commission merchant is required by the Act and Commission regulations in part 1 of this chapter or Commission orders to hold on deposit in segregated accounts on behalf of its futures customers (exclusive of its targeted residual amount obligations pursuant to § 1.3 of this chapter).</P>
                        <P>(f)(1) If there is a shortfall in the non-XM pool and no shortfall in the XM pool, all customer net equity claims, whether or not they arise out of the XM subclass of accounts, will be combined and paid pro rata out of the combined XM and non-XM pools of futures customer property.</P>
                        <P>(2) If there is a shortfall in the XM pool and no shortfall in the non-XM pool, customer net equity claims arising from the XM subclass of accounts must be satisfied first from the XM pool, and customer net equity claims arising from the non-XM subclass of accounts must be satisfied first from the non-XM pool.</P>
                        <P>(3) If there is a shortfall in both the non-XM and XM pools:</P>
                        <P>(i) If the non-XM shortfall as a percentage of the segregation requirement for the non-XM pool is greater than or equal to the XM shortfall as a percentage of the segregation requirement for the XM pool, all customer net equity claims will be paid pro rata out of the combined XM and non-XM pools of futures customer property; and</P>
                        <P>(ii) If the XM shortfall as a percentage of the segregation requirement for the XM pool is greater than the non-XM shortfall as a percentage of the segregation requirement for the non-XM pool, non-XM customer net equity claims will be paid pro rata out of the available non-XM pool, and XM customer net equity claims will be paid pro rata out of the available XM pool.</P>
                        <P>(4) In this way, non-XM customers will never be adversely affected by an XM shortfall.</P>
                        <P>(g) The following examples illustrate the operation of this framework 1. The examples assume that the FCM has two futures customers, one with exclusively XM accounts and one with exclusively non-XM accounts.</P>

                        <P>
                            The Commission has established the following allocation convention with respect to futures customer funds (as § 1.3 of this chapter defines such term) and Cleared Swaps Customer Collateral (as § 22.1 of this chapter defines such term) (both of which are customer funds (as § 1.3 of this chapter defines such term) that are segregated pursuant to the Act and Commission rules thereunder), which applies in certain circumstances when futures customer funds or Cleared Swaps Customer Collateral are held by a futures commission merchant in a depository outside the United States (“U.S.”) or in a foreign currency. If a futures commission merchant enters into bankruptcy and maintains futures customer funds or Cleared Swaps Customer Collateral in a depository outside the U.S. or in a depository located in the U.S. in a currency other than U.S. dollars, the trustee shall use the following allocation procedures to calculate the claim of each public customer in the futures account class or each public customer in the cleared swaps account class, as applicable, when a sovereign action of a foreign government or court has occurred that contributes to shortfalls in the amounts of futures customer funds or Cleared Swaps Customer Collateral. In the event a sovereign action creates or

                            contributes to a shortfall in customer property, applying the allocation convention will result in a reallocation of distributions of futures customer funds or Cleared Swaps Collateral to take into account the impact of the sovereign action. For purposes of this bankruptcy convention, sovereign action of a foreign government or court would include, but not be limited to, the application or enforcement of statutes, rules, regulations, interpretations, advisories, decisions, or orders, formal or informal, by a Federal, state, or provincial executive, legislature, judiciary, or government agency. The trustee should perform the allocation procedures separately with respect to each public customer in the futures account class or cleared swaps account class.
