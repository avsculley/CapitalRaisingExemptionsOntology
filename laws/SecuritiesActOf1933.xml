                <p style="-uslm-dtd:para; margin-left:2em">(2) since enactment of that legislation, considerable evidence has been presented to Congress that a number of securities class action lawsuits have shifted from Federal to State courts;</p>
                <p style="-uslm-dtd:para; margin-left:2em">(3) this shift has prevented that Act from fully achieving its objectives;</p>
                <p style="-uslm-dtd:para; margin-left:2em">(4) State securities regulation is of continuing importance, together with Federal regulation of securities, to protect investors and promote strong financial markets; and</p>
                <p style="-uslm-dtd:para; margin-left:2em">(5) in order to prevent certain State private securities class action lawsuits alleging fraud from being used to frustrate the objectives of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, it is appropriate to enact national standards for securities class action lawsuits involving nationally traded securities, while preserving the appropriate enforcement powers of State securities regulators and not changing the current treatment of individual lawsuits.</p>
                <p style="-uslm-dtd:para; margin-left:1em">Section 101(c) of that Act contained the following effective date provision for the amendment to section 16 of the Securities Act of 1933 and section 28(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934:</p>
